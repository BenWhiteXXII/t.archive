A Bosnian girl, holding an AK-47 rifle smokes a cigarette as she waits for a funeral service at Sarajevo's Lion's cemetery on Monday, Sept. 14, 1992. 
During this, mortar shells slammed into downtown streets despite U.N. supervision of at least some of the heavy Serb weaponry ringing Sarajevo. At least 3 people were killed and 32 wounded that day. 
Allegedly, this woman is Fadila Odžaković Žuta, a Bosnian celebrity of sorts during the war, winning the Golden Lily and the Golden Crest With Swords. Fadila ended up dying six days after this photo was taken because of wounds she suffered after an attack on Žuč Hill.
