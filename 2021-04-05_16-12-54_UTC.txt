Clarence Coles Phillips (October 3, 1880 â€“ June 13, 1927) was an American artist and illustrator who is known for his stylish images of women and a signature use of negative spaces in the paintings he created for advertisements and the covers of popular magazines. 
In 1907, Phillips met with a J. A. Mitchell, the publisher of Life magazine, and was hired onto its staff at the age of twenty-six. Phillips would be associated with the magazine throughout the rest of his life. 
The artwork of Phillips quickly became popular with the Life readers. In May 1908, he drew a  unique cover for the magazine that featured his first "fadeaway girl", a design with a figure whose clothing matched, and disappeared into, the background. Phillips developed this idea in many following covers during his short-spanned career. 
Phillips's use of negative space allowed the viewer to "fill-in" the image; it also reduced printing costs for the magazine, as "the novelty of the technique and the striking design qualities masked the fact that Life (and other magazines Philips's drew for) was getting by with single color or two-color covers in a day when full-color covers were de rigueur for the better magazines" 

In 1924 he was diagnosed with tuberculosis of the kidney, and for the remainder of his life, he was frequently ill.  Phillips died in New Rochelle at his home, of his kidney ailment on June 13, 1927, at the age of forty-seven.
