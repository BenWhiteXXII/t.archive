Tatsuro Yamashita (山下 達郎) Born Febuary 4th, 1953, is a Japanese city pop, funk, and soft rock musician and songwriter. Best known in Japan for his 1983 single, "Christmas Eve." Which won him a Guinness World Record for “Most consecutive years to appear on the Japan single chart.” Due to its return to the charts nearly every single year after its release.
Prior to his career in music he was appointed manager of a factory owned by his parents, unfortunately it burned down which puahed him to look into different careers, where he decided to focus on his songwriting, heavily inspired by western music. 
His first release was with a band he formed with Taeko Ohnuki and Kunio Muramatsu called Sugar Babe, they released one title "Songs", in 1975 and broke up because critics hated their style of music. Afterwards, RCA Records signed him into a deal and the year after his solo debut, "Circus Town", was released. 
Tatsuro Kept a humble following until the early 1980s when he and his music starred in a few Maxwell commercials that gained a ton of popularity. After being asked if he was the 'Maxwell guy' on the street by an older gentlemen Tatsuro swore never to do a commercial ever again because he would prefer to be known by his music and not who he had worked for. 
In 1982, he married friend and fellow musician Mariya Takeuchi, who many of you will know for her song 'Plastic Love', which Tatsuro actually wrote for her.
Since 1976 he has released 21 different albums, with his most recent being released June of '22.
