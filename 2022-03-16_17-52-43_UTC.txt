Antiprostitution raids in Osaka and Tokyo, 1957.
The Prostitution Prevention Law (売春防止法, Baishun bōshi hō) (Law no. 118, May 24, 1956)  aimed to prevent prostitution, punish third parties involved in the trade and to protect and rehabilitate women involved in prostitution. It is also known as the 'Anti-Prostitution Law'.
Today, through liberal interpretations, loopholes and the like, the prostitution industry in Japan still makes billions yearly.
