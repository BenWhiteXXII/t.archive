Throbbing Gristle + Yellow Magic Orchestra, London, 1980.

According to Gen, after YMO had finished their set Haruomi Hosono told Genesis that they liked their Throbbing Gristle shirt, and they ended switching shirts backstage. Genesis can be seen wearing the iconic YMO shirt both in this photo and in a photo on the back of "Throbbing Gristle's Greatest Hits"
