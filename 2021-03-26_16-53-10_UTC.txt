As of recently, there will be some drastic changes coming out of this account.

I have been posting gondolas since the beginning. I had initially found this niche meme that I realized was subjected to a small and dying corner of the internet, and I wanted to help keep it alive.

So for over seven months, I posted every gondola I could find, even making my own as well, I wanted to share music I was finding so I often paired the two, which has always been pretty common on /wsg/. 

And through that, I helped grow this community. More and more pages dedicated to posting gondola content came into the light (@gondola.feels, @gondolaspace, @Gondola.poster), and more and more people have been discovering this little man.

I really love this community I have grown, and I enjoy running this account, but I think I have paid my dues in full. After posting well over 800 Gondolas, I think I need to give it a rest.

I am not leaving this account, I didn't build this just to abandon it, but there are only so many gondolas out there, and others can continue the legacy.

I want to direct the content style of the page to something more mature, I want to begin posting more stuff directed at history, culture, music, religion, and art.

I am not going to stop immediately, but gondola posting is going to slow down and simmer out.

Thanks, anons for this lovely experience.
