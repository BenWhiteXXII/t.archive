“Vanitas: Flesh dress For an Albino Anorexic” Jana Sterbak (1987)

Created through 50 to 60 lb of flank steak sewn together, which must be constructed a new each time it is shown. According to the artist, the work is a contrast between vanity and bodily decomposition. Initially, the steak is fresh and fiery red, and then it gradually turns beige and brown, changing its shape and size to conform to the dummy's hourglass shape.
