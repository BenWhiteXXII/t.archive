Pictures of Julia "Butterfly" Hill, who spent 738 days at the top of an ancient 1500-year-old coast redwood tree called "Luna" to stop the attempts being made to clearcut the area by the Pacific Lumber Company.
She lived on two 6x6 foot platforms in the canopy, 150 feet in the air, between December 10, 1997 and December 18, 1999, only descending when the lumber company agreed to not cut down the tree, and to spare a 200 foot "buffer zone" around it as well. 
She also was a member of Earth First! The entire time and had no "tree-sitting" experience previously. She survived by supplies given to her by volunteers who hiked over two miles up the mountainside to reach her.
