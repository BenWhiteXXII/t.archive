In 1984, for all promotional art, photographs, and touring around the album '玉姫様 (Tamahime sama)' Japanese punk/avant-garde musician Jun Togawa would don the wings of a dragonfly. 
Throughout her career Jun held an interest in the morose, endearingly distraught, and especially the indifferent bugs, for her debut album her focus seemed mostly to be on her aspirations to be a bug herself. With many of the song titles and lyrics discussing militaristic insects, larvae and pupa, and, of course, forests.
 
In an interview she said: 
"Now I know why I've been so strongly attracted to parasites and worms. It's a feeling of basic continuity with life. I feel as if there's a basic continuity between humans and these creatures.  I might even call this feeling "love." Humans and other creatures are not as different as they look."

Throughout her music Jun has held the themes of wanting to "evolve" into something else as a form of escapism:
“There is a feeling I've had ever since childhood: that there exist many  different 'worlds' and I was born in the wrong one, a world I don't quite fit into. I've felt this strong feeling of wrongness all through my life. There is no space for me in this world. Every time I believe  I've finally found my place, someone comes to me and says "Go away!  You're not supposed to be here." – Jun Togawa.
