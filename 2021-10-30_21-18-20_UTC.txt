The constant "aesthetic warwave" posts we see on social media generally softens the blow of what these things really are depicting. Many of us live relatively comfortable lives and only someone truly out of touch and delusional would actually envision themselves in war simply for the sake of war or "glory" and not some real life goal that must be attained. 
You are a lot more tame then you give yourself credit, keep that in mind.
