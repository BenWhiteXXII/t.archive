Acid folk musician Dave Bixby, late 60s.

Known for his 1969 album, "Ode to Quetzalcoatl," which was a private pressing of a small selection of a body of work that had amassed around 30 original songs. Bixby was a member of a Christian cult known as "The Movement," and he was asked to use his songs to help gather attention from the local youth. When "The Movement" split up after its leadership ran away with funds, multiple members took their own lives, and Bixby decided to become a sailor instead of a singer.
