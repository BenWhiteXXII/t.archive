In 2009 Muammar Gaddafi hired 500 girls from a "hostess agency" to attend a party in Rome, with the requirements they be "attractive, dressed modestly, between 18 and 35, and around 5'7."
But upon their arrival to his "party" he instead gave them a two-hour lecture on Islam and the nature of women in it. 

During his speech Gaddafi claimed that it is untrue that Islam is against women, and  said in the West women "have often been used as pieces of furniture, changed whenever it pleases men, and this is an injustice."
Afterwards there was a q&a session, and at midnight the girls were sent home each with a copy of the Koran in Italian, as well as a signed copy of his "Green Book."
