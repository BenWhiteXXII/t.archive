A young couple at the end of the Romanian Revolution, December, 1989. 

The revolution overthrew the Communist dictatorship that terrorized the citizens at the time, and ended with Nicola Ceausescu and his wife being executed. 

The carnations in the gun barrels are supposed to symbolize peace, probably a reference to the Portuguese 'Carnation Revolution' that overthrew Americo Tomas and his regime in 1974.
