"Capitalists want you to be constantly stimulated, consuming, and doing something different from what you were a minute ago – it’s about distraction. Stopping you staying in one place for a length of time because that doesn’t make any money.
 “So to have music, or forms of art, that say, ‘You don’t need very much,’ during a time when we’re harvesting the results of over-consumption, those are actually very important messages – you can make do with less.”- Brian Eno.
