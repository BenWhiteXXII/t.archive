In 1963, photographer Ken Griffiths followed a year in the life of Mr and Mrs Sweetmanâ€™s beautiful cottage garden in East Sussex. Every month, he took one picture in the exact same spot.

In the last photo Mrs. Sweetman stayed inside because of how cold it was, you can see that her husband is standing to the other side because she is actually in the kitchen window if you look closely.
