Yukiko Okada and Mariya Takeuchi. Mid 80s

Okada was a popular Idol in Japan, with her career starting when she was only 16 years old. Takeuchi was a popular musician, close friend, and songwriter who wrote many of her popular hits.
On April 8, 1986, Yukiko Okada was found in her apartment, crying, twisted slashed, having crawled into her closet to die.
She was discovered by a rescue team who came to investigate her apartment as she had tried to fill it with gas. She was taken to the nearby Kitano Aoyama Hospital soon after, given medical treatment. 
She was then moved to the office on the 6th floor of the Sun Music Building, and as her management team were outside discussing how to avoid a scandal she took off her shoes and jumped.

She died instantly.

Following her death many "copycat suicides" appeared, redefining the term as "Yukiko Syndrome."
