The back tires were out of alignment, twisting to the right every time you made a turn. They slipped on the rain.

It was one of those days where it looked like night, grey-skied while the radio stations hovered between classical and Chada FM. 

The bus came to a rolling, groaning stop in a quiet railroad town. You tipped your hat at the statue of the frog on a bicycle in the town's center. What it meant, you didn't know, but you hadn't ever gotten out to check. You couldn't remember the last time you had gotten up.

You opened the doors. The small man of the forest blinked blearily up at you.

"I don't have the change," he said quietly.

"I do."

He clambered aboard the ramp, pressing a walnut into your palm with his warm, calloused own. His fur smelled like the time you hid in a pile of leaves during a storm. You put it in the glovebox.

The seat creaked as he sat down, and sighed. You adjusted your mirror. 

The bus pulled out of the lot, and into the night.

1995 was a good year
