The Visoki Decani Monastery in Kosovo has been under UNESCO protection since 2005 and under KFOR protection since ’99. During this time the monastery was the target of four armed attacks – two mortar attacks in 2000 and 2004, a hand grenade rocket attack in 2007, as well as several other terrorist attack attempts.
