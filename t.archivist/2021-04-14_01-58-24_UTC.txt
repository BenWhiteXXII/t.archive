"Take Me Back!" appeared in Young Romance #151 (December/January 1967) and "Revenge" appeared in Girls' Love Stories #170 (June 1972),

The only difference between the two comics were the name change, and the races of the main characters. 

Although reselling an old comic strip a few years later wasn't uncommon, with maybe hairstyles updated, changing such major factors as the protagonists' race was not common.
