Artwork by #marvinrubin, for the books "Mother Earthâ€™s Hassle-free Indoor Plant Book" and "Grow With Your Plants" by Lynn and Joel Rapp and the album artwork for #plantasia by #mortgarson 

Plantasia was released in 1976, available only by buying a house plant at the "Mother Earth" garden store in Los Angeles, or a Simmons mattress at Sears. The only further marketing given to the album was it's claims as being "music for plants", probably influenced by the scientific findings that some plants react positivity to music. The album was also entirely played on a Moog synthesizer.
