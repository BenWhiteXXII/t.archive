Some of the last photographs taken of Andrei Tarkovsky with one of his beloved pet birds, 1986.

Both Andrei, his wife, multiple crew members, and actors either died or got sick due to the toxic environment Stalker (1979) was filmed in. Even worse, Stalker has to be reshot a second time after the original film deteriorated. The reshoot of the movie, the one that we all know, was notably radically different from the original.
