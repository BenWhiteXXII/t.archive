"This is unbelievable...but true! 
This may be a first... A couple from Montana were out riding on the range, he with his rifle and she (fortunately) with her camera. Their dogs always followed them, but on this occasion, a Mountain Lion decided that he wanted to stalk the dogs (you'll see the dogs in the background watching). 

The hunter got off the mule with his rifle and decided to shoot in the air to scare away the lion, but before he could get off a shot the lion charged in and decided he wanted a piece of those dogs. With that, the mule took off and decided HE wanted a piece of that lion. That's when all hell broke loose for the lion. 

As the lion approached the dogs, the mule snatched him up by the tail and started whirling him around. Banging its head on the ground on every pass. Then he dropped it, stomped on it and held it to the ground by the throat. The mule then got down on his knees and bit the thing all over a couple of dozen times to make sure it was dead, then whipped it into the air again, walked back over to the couple (that were stunned in silence) and stood there ready to continue his ride as if nothing had just happened.

Fortunately, even though the hunter didn't get off a shot, his wife got off these three pictures." - Via AndyAndrews.com

The above story is unfortunately fake, The photographs are taken from an article in "Western Mule Magazine," and were given a fabricated story. According to the original article the man who took these photos regularly rides a mule and hunts mountain lions, according to him his mule becomes more and more aggressive towards mountain lions with each hunt. But has never attacked one that hasn't already been shot. Please do not use a mule instead of a guard dog üê∂.
