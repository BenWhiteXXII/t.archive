I have this book called "a dictionary of angels; including the fallen angels" by Gustav Davidson. It basically includes every historical or literary reference to an angel or a demon throughout mythology and fiction alphabetized. Every single time I become friends with someone I look up their name in the dictionary of angels and demons to see where they are placed.
