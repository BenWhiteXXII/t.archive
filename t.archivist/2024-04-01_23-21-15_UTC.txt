“Luminous Earth Grid,” an array of 1,680 energy-efficient fluorescent lamps, sweeps over an area equal to 8 football fields, 50 miles north of San Francisco, 1993.
The project, created by Stuart Williams, took over 5 years of planning and half a million dollars in donations before it could be completed.
“I see the project as a poetic statement on the potential harmony between technology and nature.”
