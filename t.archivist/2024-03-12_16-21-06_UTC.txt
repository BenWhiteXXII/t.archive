The still-robed skeleton of St Stephen of Sinai, who died in 580 AD. St Katherine's Monastery, Egypt. 

Stephen was reportedly a monk who lived in the gate to the entrance to Mt. Sinai. He received confession from anyone who intended to reach the monastery above, so that they may be spiritually cleaned.

Photos are circa 2007, with the exception of the last one which is more recent.
