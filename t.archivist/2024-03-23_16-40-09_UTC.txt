The Dial-A-Poem Poets. 
Originally formed by John Giorno in 1968 after a phone call with William Burroughs, citing that "much poetry is intended to be read, not merely heard."
The Dial-A-Poem hotline system worked by allowing laymen and the public to call 'Giorno Poetry Systems' and have a randomly selected poem read to them by writers such as Frank O'Hara, Amiri Baraka, William Burroughs, Ed Sanders,  John Cage, Allen Ginsberg, Bobby Seale, Patti Smith, Diane Di Prima, and Anne Waldman. 

The hotline was so popular that it captured the attention of the FBI and eventually was shut down in 1970, although it had several resurrections and today exists as an app.
