"He was the world's worst fiddle player! He was scratching his way through Hank Williams' "You Win Again" when all of a sudden he stomped it into a hundred pieces. Every time he destroyed one I faced East and thanked someone. Once at Uncle Seymour's house this girl handed Townes a brand-new fiddle and without saying a word he walked over to the charcoals that were just getting ready for the goat Townes bought for the picnic and laid it on them. It smoldered for a few seconds then burst into flames. He liked to shock people, whether on or off stage." - Wrecks "Rex" Bell on TVZ's fiddle playing.
