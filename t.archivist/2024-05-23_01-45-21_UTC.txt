Susuke!! by Masahisa Fukase, 1977-1979.

After Masahisa and his wife, Yoko, split in 1976 a photographer friend gifted him a young kitten to keep him company. Fukase decided to name the kitten Sasuke after the ninja Sasuke Sarutobi because of the young animal’s bold personality and energetic behavior. However the cat soon after disappeared and when it became clear he wasn’t going to return Fukase placed posters around his neighborhood asking for leads on his missing kitten. A few days later a neighbor came to his door with a stray kitten he had found but it was clear that this was a different animal. Fukase named him Sasuke II and took him everywhere he went, photographing him nonstop. As Sasuke grew older and less erratic he adopted another kitten he named Momoe, because of its sad eyes. This way Sasuke could have company, and Momoe a mentor. Looking back on his time photographing them Fukase wrote:
“I wasn’t interested in the grace or cuteness of cats. I saw myself reflected in the cat’s eyes. I wanted to photograph the love I saw there.”
