A discovery of human bones with an old knife and the remains of a Springfield rifle beneath a moose skeleton somewhere near Kalispell, Montana in 1923. 

The unidentified hunter had apparently shot the moose and was then fatally wounded by the animal before they both perished together. It is not known when exactly the hunter died but it was likely years before his remains were discovered.

An article originally ran by the Daily Inter Lake of Kalispell on July 16th of '23 describes the scene as follows:

"Mute evidence of a tragedy of the woods was discovered a few days ago by Joe McKelvey, park ranger, in the vicinity of Many Glaciers chalet, Glacier National Park.

In a thicket about three miles north, Mr. McKelvey ran across the skeleton of a moose, and upon closer investigation, found parts of a human skeleton, which clearly showed that some hunter years ago had shot and wounded a moose and then been killed by the animal. Close by was found a Springfield 45-70 rifle with the breech open, and a shell which had stuck told how the hunter had lost his life. He had evidently fought to a finish for a broken knife (that) was found on the ground.

Old-timers in the vicinity of the park are of the opinion the skeleton is that of a French-Canadian trapper who disappeared about 18 years ago, but none remember his name."
