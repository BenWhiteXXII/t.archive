10 years ago today Chris Dorner was killed.
 He went to war with the LAPD after murdering two officers, & some family members of other officers. This sparked a huge man hunt for him that ended in him being killed.
 What the media left out was that he himself was a LAPD officer for years and a veteran. Until one day while serving a warrant with his white female partner, his partner used excessive force in his opinion, he filed a complaint against his fellow officer for assaulting a mentally ill man after he was already cuffed. 
After fighting for this country over sea’s and coming home and trying to protect these streets, him being a “good” cop and reporting to the department about his partners misconduct ended in him being fired from the LAPD. He went through every legal avenue he could to try and get his job back but never did. That partnered with whatever other issues he had personally turned him to fight with the LAPD.
