Hell's Angels and other counterculture biker groups regularly participated in Homoerotic behavior and kissing to shock cops and non-bikers alike as well as an assertion of their own masculinity.

"[Kissing] is a guaranteed square-jolter, and the Angels are gleefully aware of the reaction it gets  The sight of a photographer invariably whips the Angels into a kissing frenzy." -Hunter S Thompson 

This tradition actually still continues to this day.
