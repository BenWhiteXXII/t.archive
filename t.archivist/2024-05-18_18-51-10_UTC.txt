Vivienne Tam S/S 1995. Pop-art Maoism.

Vivienne Tam was born in Guangzhou in 1957, almost ten years after Mao formed the People’s Republic of China in 1949. Since her family was wealthy and owned land, they were targeted by the communist party. To escape political unrest during Mao’s regime, Tam’s family escaped to Hong Kong when she was three years old. Growing up in Hong Kong, Tam’s upbringing was a blend of Eastern and Western cultural influences. She returned to China in the late 1970s to a completely different world than she grew up in. After Mao Zedong launched the Cultural Revolution in 1966, the communist party eliminated the four olds, Old Ideas, Old Culture, Old Habits, and Old Customs, to which fashion was included. The qipaos and Western suits from the 1920s and 1930s were replaced with the Zhongshan suit and military-like clothing.

In 1994, Tam was introduced to the artist Zhang Hongtu and they collaborated for her spring 1995 collection. Tam explained, “His art was political, but I thought I could loosen it up a bit with fashion, to represent the openness of China. This would show its humor and warmth, and the growing freedom of its people from Mao’s image” .However, once the designs were completed, Tam had trouble manufacturing the collection. Due to the power Mao’s image still held, dozens of factories refused her order. When one finally accepted and completed the garments, they were sent to Tam disguised in layers of brown paper.
Once the collection was shown in New York in November 1994 the reactions were mixed. Zhang explained, “People who looked at the collection had different reactions to the images depending on where they were from and the bodies that wore them”. For example, some buyers did not know who Mao was and one asked if it was a portrait of Tam’s father. Others made the connection to Andy Warhol’s Mao portraits. -fashionhistory.com
