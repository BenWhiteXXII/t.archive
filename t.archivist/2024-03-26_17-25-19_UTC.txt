Letícia Parente, Tarefa 1 (Chore 1) , 1982. Brazil. 

"Letícia lies on an ironing board in front of her maid who calmly irons her mistress, clothed, with the same attention to detail as someone who irons out a flat piece of clothing. The artist is calm like an empty suit; she doesn’t move, she doesn’t complain, she simply lies there. She is an ordinary piece of clothing, on any given day. There is no indifference, it is just another task accomplished. In the mistress maid relationship there is no tension, just silent complicity."- artbasel.com
