City of the Broken Dolls: A Medical Art Diary, 1993-96. 

Romain Slocombe's "trauma history" of medical fetishism on the streets and stretchers of 90s Tokyo is unique. These girls, victims of unknown accidents present a city with a seething undercurrent of violent fantasy. Driven by a fascination with accidents, Slocombe took black and white photographs of these victims, and juxtaposed them in a way with the history of erotic photographers such as Nobuyoshi Araki or Helmut Newton. Images coalesce, and some would argue clash, sexuality with apparent bodily injuries.
 
But why? 
 
In "Cinema, Pain, and Pleasure" (2013) Steve Allen says of this photobook: "The spectator has witnessed a delight. Acting as a physiognomic biography, the scar indicates body experience and mystery. But a scar is more than a memory, it has a metamorphic property; thus, from the initial gash, it bleeds, it scabs, it weeps, and eventually heals and begins to fade. During his time in hospital, the changes to the marks on a body operate as a progression of time, with successive scenes showing gradually reduced swelling, leg hoists removed, and stitches gone."
