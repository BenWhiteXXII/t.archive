C. Michael Dudash[1952-] 

Dudash before 2002 never really focused on the old west scenes you see here. Though he was particularly great at handling landscapes, figures, portraits, and still lifes, Michael found that painting the characters and history of the old west especially excited him. 

He says “The subject of the great American frontier is something that I never grow tired of bringing to life in my paintings. I love the history, the characters, the costuming, the critters and the landscapes, and the ample opportunities that exist to tell a great story. The themes that permeate western art also feel like home to me – faith, family, friends, self reliance and hard work, just to name a few. It’s all there for me. I am eternally grateful that I can make a living doing what I love.”

Dudash is personally one of my favorite oil painters and has numerous beautifully designed pieces I adore.

In another quote from him, he says, “The challenge for me as a painter is to take the subject of the old western frontier and create works of art that are moving, beautiful, timeless and universal in their appeal. As for me, I have to daily rely on the good Lord and His inspiration to help me accomplish this formidable task.”
