James Gandolfini poses with a bust of Saddam Hussein during a visit to Camp Doha, Kuwait, 2004.

Gandolfini and fellow “Sopranos” actor Tony Sirico, who played Paulie, visited U.S. troops in Kuwait and Iraq sponsored by the United Service Organizations (USO).

This same bust that Gandolfini poses with here is actually the head of a statue that marines famously pulled down a year earlier, in an attempt to make a statement about history. That same bust was also used to hold the noose that was used to hang Saddam, a noose that later was auctioned and sold, allegedly, for around seven million dollars in 2015.
