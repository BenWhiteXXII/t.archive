"Lost in Manboo: Living In A Japanese Internet Cafe," 2014.

"A four-square-metre box with a screen and computer. This is what Japanese cyber-cafes offer, around the clock.
Most customers just spend an hour or two here. But there are thousands who spend their lives in them.
The Manboo in Tokyo has its own permanent residents: Masata and Hitomi. It is a home for them, even though they sleep on the floor."

Hitomi, the girl interviewed here, allegedly took her own life a few years after this.
