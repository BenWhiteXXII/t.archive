Rudolf Schwarzkogler was an Austrian performance artist and prominent figure in Viennese Actionism, an art movement in the 1960s centered around transgressive performance art that primarily utilized the body as its canvas and unconventional elements, such as bodily fluids and bodily harm, as its paint. Common motifs in Schwarzkogler's actions include pain, mutilation, dead animals, and their entrails. Something inspired by the desolation and war he grew up around and experienced. 

Despite several news outlets misreporting his death to be caused by the amputation of his penis during a performance (A rumor created by performance artist Chris Burden), Schwarzkogler died after falling from his apartment window at the age of 28. It is uncertain whether by accident or suicide.
