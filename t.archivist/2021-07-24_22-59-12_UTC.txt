Armenian eternity symbol. 
Originally known as Arevkhach, Cross of the Sun (or Kerkhach, “ker” meaning curved and “khatch” meaning cross), it represents time, recurrence, universe, and the eternal motion of life. There are variations with 4, 6, 9, and 12 petals, but the most common is 8, representing eternity. It stemmed from worship of the sky and the sun. It shares a common origin with the swastika. Absorbed into Christian culture, the symbol became nearly as sacred as the Holy Spirit and was used on nearly every Armenian Christian design. 
Since the 5th century, it appeared on Armenian steles, and later became part of khachkar symbolism. Around the 8th century its use had become an established practice, and it keeps its meaning until the modern times. It can be found on church walls, tomb stones, and other architectural monuments. It can also be found on Armenian manuscripts, commemorative coins, as well as Armenian government agencies and non-government organizations and institutions in Armenia and the Armenian diaspora. It is also depicted on the flag of Yerevan. The symbol is also used by Armenian neopagans.
