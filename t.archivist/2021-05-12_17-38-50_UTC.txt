Everyone carries a Shadow, and the less it is embodied in the individual’s conscious life, the blacker and denser it is. At all counts, it forms an unconscious snag, thwarting our most well-meant intentions.“

“One does not become enlightened by imagining figures of light, but by making the darkness conscious.”
– Carl Jung
