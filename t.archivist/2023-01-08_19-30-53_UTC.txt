Mandrake (Mandragora officinarum) has been the subject of superstition and folklore for millennia.
Because the shape of their roots often can look like a human body magical properties were assumed onto them, which was only verified through their Healing and hallucinogenic powers. 
It used to be believed that if you pulled a mandrake root up from the ground it would scream loudly, killing who could hear it. So in order to harvest mandrake people would tie the leash of a goat or a dog around the stump of the plant and have the animal pull it up. (See illustrations 3,4,6)
They were once thought to be an aphrodisiac as well. Itâ€™s actually a parasympathetic depressant & a hallucinogen, so it would make you more stoned than horny.
