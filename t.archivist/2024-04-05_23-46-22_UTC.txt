“No Hesitation” targets produced by Law Enforcement Targets for the US Department of Homeland Security in 2013
🇺🇸 
The targets were intended to train law enforcement to shoot at civilians holding firearms and included pregnant women, children, and elderly people: 

“The subjects in NMH targets were chosen in order to give officers the experience of dealing with deadly force shooting scenarios with subjects that are not the norm during training..”
🇺🇸 
DHS ordered $2 million of these however they were soon withdrawn following public outcry. LET issued an apology: 

“We apologize for the offensive nature of our ‘No More Hesitation’ products. These products have been taken offline due to the opinions expressed by so many, including members of the law enforcement communities”
