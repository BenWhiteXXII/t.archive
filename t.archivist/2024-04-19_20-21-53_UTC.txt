Surreal Mechanical Angel Dolls by Simon Yotsuya. 1988-1996. 

Born in 1944, Yotsuya began making masks and dolls around the age of 10, but it wasn't until his early twenties when, after discovering the work of Hans Bellmer, he began to seek doll making as a serious artistic profession. 

Around this time he was known for frequenting jazz clubs where he began to befriend countless important underground artists. This eventually led him to join Juro Kara's legendary underground theater troop Jokyo Gekijo, where, because of his incredible beauty (see last slide) he would perform as a female doll and would be photographed by Japan's top photographers. 

Throughout his career would take on many different themes. Starting with "standard" dolls that held some sort of artistic reference or was just a display of the maker's skill. It wouldn't be until the late '70s when he started experimenting with mechanical dolls that would appear half finished, with their hearts and insides open to the world. 

 In the late '80s his work became more angelically influenced and most of his creations would be resembled after the angels. Religious symbolism, halos, unearthly beauty, and faces of fierce determination and feeling would become the hallmark of these dolls.
