Pro-palestinian murals in Ireland. ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡ª

Ireland has a long history of support for Palestine, its own experience of colonisation has shaped national sentiment towards the plight of Palestinian people and the Israeli regime, leading to a strong bond. 

In the late 1960s, Ireland was increasingly concerned about the fate of Palestinian refugees who fled the Six-Day War in 1967. In 1969, Irish Foreign Minister Frank Aiken described the problem as the "main and most pressing objective" of Ireland's Middle East policy.

The Irish Republican Army (IRA) formed military ties with the Palestinian Liberation Organisation (PLO), with members attending training camps in the Middle East and weapons smuggled from the PLO to Ireland.

 In 1980, Ireland became the first country in the EU to call for an independent Palestinian state and, in 1993, it became the last European country to receive an Israeli embassy.
