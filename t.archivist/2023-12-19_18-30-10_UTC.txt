Jimmy Page & William S. Burroughs, 1975.
William Burroughs was invited by 'Crawdaddy!' magazine to witness a Led Zeppelin show, and then interview Jimmy Page. 'Crawdaddy!' was the first exclusive rock music magazine. Started by Paul Williams, a close friend of Philip K Dick, and the husband of Sachiko Kanenobu (The Japanese Joni Mitchell). 
Williams Burroughs gave a strong review for the concert, and then discussed Aliester Crowley, Kenneth Anger (a mutual friend of both), magik, meditation, death by fire, trance music,  and of course, Wilhelm Reich's Orgone Accumulator with Jimmy Page, who offered many of his own theories as well.
