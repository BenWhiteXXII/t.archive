"You cannot see me from where I look at myself."
Francesca Woodman, untitled self-portraits in a cemetery, Boulder, Rhode Island. 

Having a career spanning only nine years, having taken up photography of the age of 13, but then committing suicide by 22. Woodman's heavy body of work was deeply inspired by the Gothic. Making use of long exposures, turning movements into total blur, and often being within the photo, but usually not quite the subject, faceless, semi-nude, and eerie. Knowing life was close to death, and human essence too limitless to be contained.
