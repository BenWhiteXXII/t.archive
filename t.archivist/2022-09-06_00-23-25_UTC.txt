Cigarette culture at Chinese weddings in the 80s and 90s.

In addition to being very popular gifts, the bride had to light a cigarette for every man attending the wedding banquet as a token of gratitude.

Cigarettes made by Double Happiness (红双喜), one of the oldest and most influential tobacco brands in China, were offered at weddings because of the lucky combination of characters in the name, symbolizing longevity and love for the newlyweds.
