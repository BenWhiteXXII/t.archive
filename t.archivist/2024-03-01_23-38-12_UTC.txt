Idaho's "Stinker Station" signs, 50s/60s. 

Created by Ferris Lind in the '30s to help get a leg up on competition in the local car service and gas industry, Stinker Station signs were arrected throughout Idaho, Colorado, and Wyoming as advertisement and humor. Typically one side would be yellow with a humourous phrase intended to amuse motorists during their long, flat, boring drives, and the other would advertise his business. 

At one point nearly 150 unique signs graced the pastures, and they were nationally known too. This was until Claudia "Ladybird" Johnson helped create the Highway Beautification Act in 1965, which aimed to remove billboards along federal highways. Lind fought back through a lawsuit claiming it deprived farmers and landowners of income, as he was paying typically 115$ in today's money per sign, monthly, to landowners who would host them. Unfortunately, it didn't get much traction and today only two signs still exist.
