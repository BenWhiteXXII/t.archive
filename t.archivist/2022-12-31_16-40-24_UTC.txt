Stinker Station Signs in Idaho, 1960s
The Stinker gas stations used to break the monotony of traveling through southern Idaho's miles of sagebrush with their comic signs. Farris Lind was the genius behind Idaho's iconic yellow road signs of the 1950s and 1960s. The signs were not only witty but captured nationwide attention.
