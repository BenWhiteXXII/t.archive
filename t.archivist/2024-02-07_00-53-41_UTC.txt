The Ama (sea women) are a group of japanese divers famous for collecting pearls. Japanese tradition holds that the practice of ama may be 2,000 years old. 

Traditionally, ama dived wearing only a white loincloth (believed to ward off sharks), but as of the 20th century, the divers adopted an all-white sheer diving uniform in order to be more presentable while diving.

Even in modern times, ama dive without scuba gear or air tanks, making them a traditional sort of free-diver. Women begin diving as ama as early as 12 years old and are known to be active well into their 70s, as they live longer due to their diving and training disciplines. The world of the ama is one marked by duty and superstition:

Early ama were known to dive for seafood and were honored with the task of retrieving abalone for shrines and imperial emperors. One traditional article of clothing that has stood the test of time is their headscarves, adorned with symbols such as the seiman and the douman which have the function of bringing luck to the diver and warding off evil.

The ama were expected to endure harsh conditions while diving, such as freezing temperatures and great pressures from the depths of the sea. In the 1940s, 6000 ama were reported active along the coasts of Japan, but as disinterest in the ancient practice continues among the new generation of women, today ama practice at numbers in the scale of 60-70 divers.
