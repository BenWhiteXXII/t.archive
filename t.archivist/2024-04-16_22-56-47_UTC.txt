Viktoria Ivleva- Chernobyl, 1990.

Victoria Ivleva was one of only five photographers who, under the Soviet Union, captured the scene of the Chernobyl disaster. In 1990, four years after the fact, a team of physicists were sent to record within the sarcophagus and explore the 4th reactor. Because of her close friendships with some of these physicists, Ivleva was granted permission to take photographs, which, under the Soviet Union, we're never published.

 "I knew that I was embarking on a very dangerous affair, where everything around you speaks of danger. ...  I understood that this was not the most beautiful place on Earth."

Some of these photos display people who still worked at the functional reactors of Chernobyl, going through radiation measuring tests, or cleaning themselves with special foam. 

Through all of this, Ivleva became friends with many of the workers who had previously been stationed at Chernobyl before the disaster, or were still working there while she photographed. In an interview a year later she said: "I look at these men now, my friends, and shudder and think 'Oh God, I will soon see them in a coffin.'"

Looking back she has said: "Never in my life have I witnessed a scene so beautiful and so deadly."
