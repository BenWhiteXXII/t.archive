"After service and breakfast the elder monks returned to their rooms. It still was the start of the last day of the year. The young ones lingered in the snow. When one monk started the fight from the balcony, the whole courtyard was suddenly on fire. Monks throwing snow balls at each other, at the pilgrims and at anything moving. They did it with great enthusiasm. Serious men in black suddenly became innocent children again. That is what a patch of snow can trigger in a man. Even in holy men. Some of the elder monks took pictures. There were cheers and laughter after each full hit. Pilgrim Herman was heavily involved in the fight firing from the balcony on the first floor. Despite the ample shelter he received some hits on the head. The monks on the square showed excellent throwing skills, despite the lack of exercise. It was the first snow since seven years, so I heard. The battle died down only because of the lack of ammunition on the first floor. All the snow had been used. Everybody went back to their rooms as if nothing had happened. It was quite an unique experience." -Herman Voogd, Athoswebog.com
