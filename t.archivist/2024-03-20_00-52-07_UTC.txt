"Tokyo Love: Spring Fever 1994", by Nobuyoshi Araki and Nan Goldin. 

Invited by a magazine and intrigued by Araki Nobuyoshi's mystique, Nan Goldin spent 7 weeks in Tokyo, shooting couples, gays, lesbians, and other young people within underground Tokyo. And Araki, for his half of the collaboration,, inspired by Goldin's "The Ballad of Sexual Dependency," which he obtained illegally under Japan's censorship laws, photographed 100 teens as "a phenomenon of age, or genres." Together, their photographs created "Tokyo Love."
Goldin famously said of this project:
 "I came back to Tokyo in the spring of 1994 to photograph the new Japanese youth and managed to track down my own tribe. I found a household of kids who are living by the same beliefs that I did as a teenager, and who transcended any definition of hetero or homosexual‚Äù
