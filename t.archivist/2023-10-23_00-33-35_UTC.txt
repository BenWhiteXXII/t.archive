In 1944 a kitten named George (short for General Electric) was saved from drowning by a U.S. Navy crew member. George was then photographed and given a liberty card and detailed health record. 
General Electric belonged to an Ed Cope, "I pulled George out of the bay at Noumea. The Ship's photographer made up a liberty card for him. George lived with me in the Lighting Shop for over a year and went over the hill when we reached Seattle."
