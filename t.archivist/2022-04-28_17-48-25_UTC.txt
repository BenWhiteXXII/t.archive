Graffiti on the Georgia Guidestones. 
The Guidestones were made public in 1980, allegedly being funded by a group that had been planning their creation for over 20 years. 
The engravings on the stones are repeated in many modern and ancient languages and give a 'guide' on how to create a perfect society. 
The stones themselves have been widely controversial as the engravings have been interpreted as to call for population control, eugenics, and internationalism.
