Love isn't a right, it's got to be earned
Love isn't a right that's got to be learned
Maybe you spent your natural life
Loving husband or loving wife;
Were you loving and was your love returned?
Love's nobody's fool and nobody's slave
Love won't go to school and learn to behave
Ride your love on an easy rein
If Love can go it comes back again
Love will haunt us from cradle to the grave
Love's a whisper, Love's a shout
Love's a flame that could blow out
Love's all beauty but make it a duty
And Love will lie right down and die
Love, Love is a germ you'll never resist
Love, Love's the eternal will-o-the-whisp
Follow him through the darkest day
Love will glimmer and light your way
But grab at him and he flickers away out of sight
Love's enchanted, don't take it for granted
Follow him, isn't a right

--Molly Drake, mother of Nick Drake, "Love Isn't a Right"
