Bob Dylan, Karen Dalton, and Fred Neil at the Cafe Wha? 1961, by Fred W. McDarrah. 

"My favorite singer in the place was Karen Dalton—She was a tall white blues singer and guitar player, funky, lanky, and sultry. I'd actually met her before, run across her the previous summer outside Denver in a mountain pass town in a folk club. Karen had a voice like Billie Holiday's and played the guitar like Jimmy Reed and went all the way with it. I sang with her a couple of times."—Bob Dylan, Chronicles: Volume One, October 5, 2004.
