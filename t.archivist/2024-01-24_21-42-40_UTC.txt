Graphics from Black Cat Sabotage! 1996. (Pt2!)
Black Cat Sabotage! was a one off collection of essays, poems, articles, and graphics that had once circulated between various green anarchist, punk, and ALF zines in the early 90s. The cream of the crop was combined together in a sort of 'best of' by an unknown individual, and subsequently the few copies passed many hands and were eventually scanned onto the internet in the early 2000s, which would be the originator of how you may have seen some of the more infamous graphics seen here and in future posts. 
Articles include information on how to not leave evidence when committing ecological sabotage (or "monkey wrenching"), good political organization strategy, the Unabomber (a contemporary topic at the release of this zine), and stories of ALF raids. 

Thankfully one of these copies reached my hands around 3 years ago, and being unhappy with some of the quality of scans online I decided to pick up some of my favorite graphics and scan and isolate them for everyone's viewing pleasure.

Some of these will be reprinted on high quality Union-Made blanks at @pinakotheca_ ' so keep your eyes out for that. ðŸ˜‰
