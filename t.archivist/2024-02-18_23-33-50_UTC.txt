"Eyes as Big As Plates," is an ongoing project since 2011 by Riitta Ikonen and Karoline Hjorth. Beginning  as a play on characters from Nordic folklore and mythology, it has evolved into a search for mankind's rightful place in nature. 
At first the photos sought to contextualize and personify the history of folklore surrounding forests and their mythic creatures by dressing up people in absurd costumes of bark, grass, flowers, and moss, but beyond all of that the project soon found a new meaning. 
These photos are produced in collaboration with retired farmers, fishermen, zoologists, plumbers, opera singers, housewives, artists, academics and ninety year old parachutists. Each person a solitary figure in a landscape, dressed in the elements that make it up and nothing else. That way these characters can literally inhabit the landscape by wearing it as a sculpture in a sense, and be totally immersed. In a way, personifying their surroundings.
