"Old pictures of the family pet. His sire was a pureblood Alaskan Timber wolf, and his dam was a pureblood Canadian Buffalo wolf." Date unknown. 

Wolf fact: In the 1980s Cormac McCarthy and Edward Abbey devised a plan to reintroduce wolves to Southern Arizona to help repair their dwindling population. The idea was that they would take Mexican wolves and release them in areas far away from cities. Unfortunately Edward Abbey passed away before they were able to carry out this plan.
