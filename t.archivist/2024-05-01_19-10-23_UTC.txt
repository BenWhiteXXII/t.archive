Ivory to Burn, Kenya, 2016.

President Kenyatta, along with other African leaders stood their ground against illegal ivory poaching by holding a ceremony where they destroyed 1/20th of the entire global supply, saying:

“Kenya is making a statement that for us ivory is worthless unless it is on our elephants. This will send an absolutely clear message that the ivory trade must come to an end and our elephants must be protected. I trust that the world will join us to end the horrible suffering of our herds and save our elephants for future generations.” 

The ceremony was designed to highlight the decline in Africa’s wild elephant population and the impact of poaching. As each year more than 30,000 elephants are killed for their tusk globally.

Regardless, Kenya’s methods are working. Harsher penalties for poaching have been introduced, and the conviction rate has risen from 20% in 2013 to 90% in 2020. In 2012 449 elephants died due to poaching, but in 2021 this number dropped to less than 10. In fact, the Kenyan government has begun to view climate change, poor agricultural practices, and some of the worst droughts in the past few decades as the biggest threats to their native elephants.
