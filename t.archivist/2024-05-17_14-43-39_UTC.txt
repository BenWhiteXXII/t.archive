The Azorean Hood (known in Portuguese as “Capote e Capelo”) is a traditional garment from the Azores, worn predominantly by women until the 1930s. This striking attire comprises a round cape made of thick, resistant English cloth in dark blue or black, which drapes to the ground. The hood is supported by a metal or whalebone rim, ensuring its distinctive shape and consistency with a hemp lining.

Often part of a woman’s dowry, the Azorean Hood was passed down through generations, serving the women of the same household. Its configuration varied from island to island within the archipelago. The cloak’s imposing presence and the hood’s unique design made it a memorable sight.

Mark Twain, in his 1869 travel book “The Innocents Abroad”, described the Azorean Hood as a “marvel of ugliness”:

“This hood is of thick blue cloth, attached to a cloak of the same stuff [….] It stands up high, and spreads abroad, and is unfathomably deep. It fits like a circus tent, and a woman’s head is hidden away in it like the man’s who prompts the singers from his tin shed in the stage of an opera [….] a woman can’t go within eight points of the wind with one of them on; she has to go before the wind or not at all.”

The garments origins are controversial and something of a mystery. When Italian and Portuguese navigators first arrived, they found the Azores uninhabited. Some historians suggest that the fashion was introduced by Flemish settlers, while others believe it evolved from a combination of the mantles (sleeveless cloaks) and cowls (loose hoods) prevalent in medieval Portugal.
