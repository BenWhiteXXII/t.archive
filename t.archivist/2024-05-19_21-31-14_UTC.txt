Meat spasms in freshly butchered beef ðŸ¥©. 
This reaction can happen because of several reasons, but typically itâ€™s the nerve endings and muscles using up the last of their energy because they either donâ€™t know what to do or are reacting to the exposure to air. Eventually this action will cause the muscles to lock as the cadaver goes into rigor mortis.

Yummy!
