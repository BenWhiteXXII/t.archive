Scans from "HE DIED IN VIETNAM: Keizaburo Shimamoto's posthumous photography".

Keizaburo Shimamoto was a Japanese photojournalist known for his stark and brutal imagery.
On the 10th of February 1971 a helicopter he was riding in with three other photojournalists was shot down and presumably all were killed in it l.

In the late '90s the crash site was searched, the report, written by Richard Pyle, goes as follows:

"A team of nine Americans and some 80 Laotian
workers dug deep into a steep mountainside Saturday where a helicopter
was shot down 28 years ago, killing four news photographers covering the
Vietnam War.
Â 
After four days of excavation, the search produced many small aircraft
parts, two battered and burned steel helmets, and several scraps of
35-millimeter film - the type the journalists carried - but no human
remains...."
