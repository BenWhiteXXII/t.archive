16th Century Engraved Breastplate belonging to Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand I of Austria.

Featuring a Madonna motif it is finely engraved and wouldâ€™ve been used to show off the engravers skill as well as the owners wealth. It was probably made for a jousting tournament in Vienna, as even the most noble were expected to display their skills.
