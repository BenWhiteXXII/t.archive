A farmer in Antoli, India, set up a trail camera because he heard his dogs barking every night. What he captured was a leopard that would nightly travel to meet an older cow. The farmer spoke with the previous owner of the cow and found out that a leopard's mother had died and that the cow had fed the young leopard her milk. Because of this, the leopard grew a bond with the cow and would come to visit regularly and play/cuddle. Unfortunately, as villagers soon grew to crowds to watch this activity these visits slowed down and dispersed. October,  2002.
