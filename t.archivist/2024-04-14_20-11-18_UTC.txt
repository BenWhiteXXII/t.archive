Members of Hell's Angels engage in competitive homoerotic activities. 1960s.

Specifically recorded by Hunter S Thompson, members of the Hell's Angels were known to kiss each other, spit in each other's mouths, as well as perform other homoerotic acts. This was done to display a genuine comfortable in their own masculinity, cause a scene, and gross out undercover cops. 
In his book, "Hell's Angels," gonzo journalist Hunter S Thompson writes:
-
""They can't stand it," says Terry. "It blows their minds every 
time -- especially the tongue bit." The sight of a photographer invariably whips the 
Angels into a kissing frenzy, but I have never seen them do it among themselves, when 
there was nobody around to shock. There is an element of something besides showbiz to 
it and in serious moments now and then one of the Angels will explain it as "just one of 
the ways we let the world know we're brothers.""
-
On top of this, bikers, fully aware that lots of gay men fantasized about them, would even allow gay men to blow them for money, as also recorded by Thompson. (Although it's possible that in some regard the Hell's Angels were messing with him.)

When Kenneth Anger's "Scorpio Rising," a movie about gay Nazi bikers, was released Anger used a montage of articles about the Hell's Angels in order to help promote it. The suggested connection was so apparent that a group of Hell's Angels even went to a showing and praised the film, but said that they felt soured at the implications that the Hell's Angels was actually a gay group.
