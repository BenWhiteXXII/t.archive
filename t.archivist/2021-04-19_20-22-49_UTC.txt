The ' I Love You' lighthouse is perched facing out towards the Atlantic, it was built in 1855 and sent its  first light in 1860, on the exposed Minot’s Ledge —  named after George Minot, an 18th-Century Boston Merchant who lost a valuable ship on the rocks prior to construction of the lighthouse. The  ledge is part of the Cohasset Rocks, off Massachusetts, USA.

When, in 1894, a new flashing lantern was installed in the 34-year-old lighthouse it had a 1-4-3 sequence and very soon the number sequence was taken to represent I Love You (I /1 flash, Love /4 flashes, You /3 flashes). Over the  years this simple lighthouse code has been a comfort to sailors from the  area, their sweethearts and families.
