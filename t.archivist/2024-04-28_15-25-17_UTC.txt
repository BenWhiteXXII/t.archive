The Chimbu tribe of New Guinea. 

Using a mixture of riverbank clay and ash the chimbu tribe paint themselves as skeletons and corpses as a powerful intimidation tactic, believing that it will give their enemies the message that they are beyond life and death.

Beyond this, almost nothing is known about the Chimbu, who are simply one of many majorly isolated tribes in New Guinea 

Every year, along with many other tribes, they travel to the six-day Mount Hagen festival where over 60 other groups travel to perform and display their cultures amongst themselves. 

The Chimbu, also known as the Simbu, or Kuman, were first recorded to exist in 1934, and outside of photographs taken at these festivals next to nothing is known about them.

'What you can see in these photos are a group of Chimbu Skeleton Tribes making their way to the arena for Mount Hagen festival as well as their behind the scene and how they prepare for the festival,' 

'Very little is known about this tribe and that makes their body paint more fascinating. My aim is to showcase richness and mysteriousness in Papua New Guinea cultures/tribes.
