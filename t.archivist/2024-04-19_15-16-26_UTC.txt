Photographs by William Klein

William Klein’s unconventional approach to photography helped expand the aesthetic boundaries of the medium and paved the way for street photography. Klein briefly studied painting, and he worked as Fernand Léger’s assistant early in his career. Without any formal education in photography, Klein embraced unconventional methods: He used wide-angle lenses and created high-contrast grain and blur. His frames could be garish or nearly abstract, and they often captured the raw intensity of modern urban life. Klein is especially renowned for his fashion photography—he shot for Vogue starting in the 1950s—and for his expansive photo essays on cities including New York, Rome, Moscow, and Tokyo, which were published as books that he designed, wrote, and typeset himself. Klein has also produced a number of films.
