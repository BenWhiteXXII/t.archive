Three whitetail bucks locked horns together in battle and drowned together in a creek in Ohio, 2010. 

The deer were found by a forester named Jason Good (seen wearing an incredible knit sweater in slide 3) who contacted the landowner and a conservation officer to verify that the find was legit. In order to preserve the locking they decided to cut the heads off of two of the deer and drag the full body of one back into a truck. Presumably to eventually be mounted in some way.
