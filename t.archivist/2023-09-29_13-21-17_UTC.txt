2: David Bowie with Ryuichi Sakamoto and Akiko Yano, 1983, by Denis O'Regan.

Director Nagisa Ōshima chose Ryuichi Sakamoto after seeing some photography of his, and without even meeting him. The film was Sakamoto's debut soundtrack work just as it was his inaugural acting role. David Bowie was chosen after Ōshima saw him in a production of "Elephant Man" on Broadway, and said he had an "indestructible spirit". 
Additionally, Ōshima, according to Bowie, would give the Japanese actors details that were incredibly and extremely precise, But then would tell the western actors to "just do whatever you people do." Bowie said it was his most crediblr performance up to date at the time, and was extremely pleased.
