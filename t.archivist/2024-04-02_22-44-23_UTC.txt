Bernard Tschumi, Advertisements for Architecture, 1976-78.

In the 1960s, a small oppositional element in architecture forged its own counterculture by turning its energies away from building toward writing. Born of a desire to foreground the intellectual dimension of architecture by associating it with developments in conceptual art, linguistics, and philosophy, this turn toward writing soon engaged architecture with broader questions of pop culture, mass media, advertising, and emerging technologies.

During this period, avant-garde theorist and architect Bernard Tschumi created “Advertisements for Architecture”, a series of postcard-sized juxtapositions of words and images, based on the idea that most of us experience architecture through photographs, drawings and words in books, in other words, through our imagination and not through the experience of real space.

In creating these, Tschumi wanted to trigger a desire in the viewer for something beyond the actual post card, and to explore what commodification of architecture as 'products' would do in the interest in promoting the production of architecture.

Tschumi's advertisements were also used to critique mainstream aesthetics, urban living and contemporary architectural works in general. Applying his theory that, "There is no way to perform architecture in a book. Words and drawings can only produce paper space, not the experience of real space. By definition, paper space is imaginary: it is an image" Tschumi's aim was to supply visual images juxtaposed with theory in order to discuss the disconnect between "the immediacy of spatial experience and the analytical definition of theoretical concepts."
