Ken Lum- Portrait Repeated Text Series 1991-1995.

Vancouver-born conceptual artist Ken Lum combines photographic images with text, sculpture, and experiments with language to explore how individuals are positioned within a society and the nature of distinctions in race and class. This series intersects work and stress and other persistent concerns throughout our lives.
 In many of Lum’s pieces, the implied words of the figure are addressed to nobody in particular. Lum highlights the banal and the ordinary of daily life in his pieces that spotlight the most camouflaged acts of self-reflection in solitude.
