30 years ago today Kurt Cobain took his own life. He was found three days later on April 8th -when these photos were taken. 

In 1993, when Kurt met his hero William Burroughs, Burroughs was noted to have said of Kurt afterwards:
"There's something wrong with that boy, He frowns for no good reason."

RIP
