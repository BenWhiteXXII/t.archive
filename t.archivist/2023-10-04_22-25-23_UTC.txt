Photography by Sam Ehrlich, Life Magazine, November 13th and 1970. 

"Sam Ehrlich is a highly disciplined medical research photographer in California who makes precise images through the microscope for science and industry. When on vacation he steps back to record vast landscapes but with the same kind of definitive-ness"..."The alternating fields of green wheat and yellow rape sum up his impressions of Canada's Alberta province: a land that is simple, straight and significant. "

The first photo was used as the artwork for "Stratosphere," by @thisisduster
