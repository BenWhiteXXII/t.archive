River Phoenix and Milton Nascimento,  July 7th, 1990. 

“My first contact with River Phoenix was around 1988. I was in New York, had just finished a four-month tour, with shows in more than 40 cities, in Asia, Europe and America. Before returning to Brazil, I spend a few days in a hotel near Central Park. On a afternoon, I was watching TV in the hotel when started a movie: The Mosquito Coast. The name of River Phoenix in the credits immediately caught my attention, but until then I had never heard of him. When the movie was over, I was paying attention to the credits and, to my surprise, the actor who I had liked most was precisely River Phoenix. On the same day, also passed another film of him on TV: Stand By Me. I was so impressed that I decided to write a letter to him. That’s when a ready song came up in my head. I put the name: “River Phoenix (Carta a um jovem ator)”. [Letter to a young actor in English] 

Some time later, in the recording of the album Milton, I was willing to record the music. But I needed a permit. I called Quincy Jones, who handed me the contact of the actor’s mother.  He initially was told no bye River's mother, one of her daughters convinced her to change her mind after saying she was "fond of that Brazilian singer."
