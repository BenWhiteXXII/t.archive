"It was after the New Year's holiday. I had been released in 1994 and had come from Ukraine back home to the village of Chapaevska. I set up a commercial operation and you understand that a commercial operation for a gypsy means narcotics. I was pulling in a pretty sum of money. My mother died and then all my money was gone; I spent it on the funeral. That was on the 22nd of March. Then a girl comes up to me and she says, "Senka, they've gone off to dig up your mother.' They were three gypsies. I went to the cemetery with my Winchester[rifle] and my knife. We, as Muslims, bury people with tombs and we surround all of this with bricks, walls and base. And here they were with two shovels, a pick and a crowbar. They wanted to dig up the gold, money and jewels we buried in her grave...

I shot two of them right away and the third one began to beg for mercy saving that he wasn't guilty, that the other ones had put him up to it. I said to him, 'Of course,' and I also cut off his head. I cut off the heads of all three of them and placed them atop the neighboring fence posts. I drove to my brother's house and told him what happened. He told me, 'You shouldn't have done that. You broke the law.' I came home, drank another bottle [of liquor], gathered up my things and drove down to the local police station and turned myself in. I arrived there with my confession and we drove to the cemetery again where I showed them where the corpses were and where the heads were hung up.'
