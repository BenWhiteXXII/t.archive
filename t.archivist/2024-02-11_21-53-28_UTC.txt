oyster shell ghosts (liquid emulsion on shells) by tina rowe.

“this work in the baldest terms comes from a series of negatives that were found at a car boot sale. i have printed them on oyster shells that were discarded into the thames over many years. i like the literalness of printing a discarded thing on another discarded thing and the work that was needed to reveal the images from difficult negatives.”
