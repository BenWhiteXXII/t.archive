Pigeon Photography ìÖç

Aerial photography technique that utilised homing pigeons outfitted with aluminium breast harnesses to which a time delayed mini camera could be attached. 

The technique was invented by a German apothecary, Julius Neubronner, who used the pigeons to deliver medications. Neubronner‚Äôs patent application was  initially rejected but in December 1908 it was granted to him after he produced authenticated photographs from the pigeons.

The military usage of pigeon photography for reconnaissance got its start in battlefield tests during World War 1. It even provided encouraging results, but the rapid perfection of aviation during the war decreased the interest in pigeon photography and Neubronner gave up on his experiments. 

Though it wouldn‚Äôt be the end of them for sure, as they were resurrected by a Swiss clockmaker in the 1930s and were used in the German and French militaries. War pigeons were used extensively throughout the Second World War, but it is unclear to what extent, if any, were used in aerial reconnaissance. 

The CIA also later developed a battery-powered camera designed for pigeon photography in espionage, though details of its exact use remain unknown. News reports claim that the camera was used during the 1970s, and that the pigeons were released from planes, but the project was a complete failure.

Other than military usage, the pigeons were used for ecological research projects and art projects alike.
