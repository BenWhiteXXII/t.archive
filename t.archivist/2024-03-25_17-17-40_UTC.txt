"Until Death Do Us Part," 
An archive of Chinese found photography from bulks of discarded 35mm negatives found in a garbage dump near Beijing. The photos feature a dying Chinese wedding custom, which involves brides lighting cigarettes to engage in 'smoking games' with the groom and guests, such as lighting a cigarette as a "thank you" for every male guest. The images, which were captured between 1985 to the early 2000s, led to the archival project that preserves ordinary moments of citizens’ lives in history.
