DEATH TO THE WORLD  Issue 1, 1994. 

"The last true rebellion is death to the world. To be crucified to the world and the world to us."

An Orthodox Christian punk zine from the 90s started by Justin Marler, one of the founding members of doom metal band Sleep, who left music to become an Orthodox monk. Justin, a former street urchin, recognized similarities behind the lifestyles of punks and Orthodox monastics and chose to use this medium as a way to reconcile the two. 

"To be a true punk is to have nothing to do with that element which kills, hurts and causes pain, but to cauterize wounds. To be in the world but not to be of the world."

Copies of this zine would be distributed at not only metal and hardcore shows but also Church drives and coffee hour (hence the actual coffee stains on this copy). 

This copy, as well as the few others that I personally own was gifted to me by my mother who was given them in the mid/late 90s when she attended St. John The Wonderworker Orthodox Church in ATL.
