Julia "Butterfly" Hill spent 738 days atop an ancient 1500-year-old coast redwood tree known as "Luna" to stop the attempts being made to clearcut the area by the Pacific Lumber Company.
She lived on two 6x6 foot platforms in the canopy, 150 feet in the air, between December 10, 1997 and December 18, 1999, only descending when the lumber company agreed to not cut down the tree, and to spare a 200 foot "buffer zone" around it as well. 
She also was a member of Earth First! The entire time and had no "tree-sitting" experience previously.

She subsisted on food given to her by other members of Earth First! Who hiked over two miles each time to reach her, the rations were usually given to her through elaborate heists because the lumber company intended to starve her out and intended to dissuade people from helping her. They also used scare tactics, such as chopping down trees next to 'Luna' and orchestrating them to fall close to the tree. Sometimes the wind caused by this would break the tarps that held together her platform. 

While on the platform she would read and research information about the forest and its ecology, And then debate on live radio with members of Pacific Lumber Company and try to reason with them.

Julia Butterfly Hill wrote and recorded all of this in her book 'The Legacy of Luna.' In this book she also notes that especially during the first year she would get so cold and scared that she would lie in a fetus position and pray to God, but refuse to come down until the needs of Luna were met.
