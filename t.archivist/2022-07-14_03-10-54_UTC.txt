A priest administers the sacrament of confession to a soldier in maximum security prison. Ukraine, 2016.

"The priest belongs to the Servants of the Holy Trinity, of the diocese of Kirovohrad, a congregation of Orthodox priests.

In mid-2016, these priests created a series of Eucharistic celebrations, baptisms and confessions for the Feast of the Trinity. And they attended dozens of inmates, ministering the sacraments over them."
