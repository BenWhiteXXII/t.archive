NAKED CITY, by Weegee, 1945. 

"Naked City" is a dark and lurid tabloid of Manhattan crime as seen through the eyes of Arthur 'Weegee' Fellig. One of the first of its kind as a photobook of a city's grimey underbelly.
Weegee got his nickname because of his uncanny and supernatural ability to arrive at crime scenes before the police -or sometimes before the crime even happened. 

Scanned by me.
