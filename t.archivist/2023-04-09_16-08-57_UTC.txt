Happy Easter/ Palm Sunday!

If you are curious why the eastern and western churches use different dates when it comes to Christmas and Easter it is because the Eastern Church use the Julian calendar to place the date of Pascha and the western church uses the Gregorian calendar to do so.

The date of Easter in the western churches falls on the first sunday after the first full moon after the spring equinox. This has been the way since the middle ages.

Orthodox Easter (Pascha) takes place between April 4 and May 8,Â following the first full moon after Passover. Orthodox Easter always falls after the Jewish celebration of Passover, because, according to the New Testament, the crucifixion and resurrection of Christ took place after he entered Jerusalem to celebrate Passover. 

More often then not the difference is only a week or two, or is celebrated on the same day. This year the Orthodox celebrate a week afterwards.
