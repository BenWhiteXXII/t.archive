“As revolutionaries, we don’t have the right to say that we’re tired of explaining. We must never stop explaining. We know that when the people understand, they cannot help but follow us.”

As President, he lowered his salary to only $450 a month and limited his possessions to a car, four bikes, three guitars, a fridge and a broken freezer. A motorcyclist himself, he formed an all-women motorcycle personal guard. He required public servants to wear a traditional tunic, woven from Burkinabe cotton and sewn by Burkinabe craftsmen. He was known for jogging unaccompanied through Ouagadougou in his track suit and posing in his tailored military fatigues, with his mother-of-pearl pistol. When asked why he didn’t want his portrait hung in public places, as was the norm for other African leaders, Sankara replied “There are seven million Thomas Sankaras.”

His interest in guitar is rooted in the 1970s, when Thomas Sankara was in a band called Tout-à-Coup Jazz. He was on guitar, while his friend, and later betrayer, Blaise Compaoré was on vocals.
