Fiona Apple in a suit of armor on a New York subway, photographed by Joe McNally in 1997.
-Excerpt from the book “The Moment it Clicks” by Joe McNally on this very shoot-
"Fiona had always been shot as a waif – tendrils of hair blowing (dressed in lingerie), out in some sort of lily field. She told me she wanted to chuck that scene and be a warrior woman in a suit of armor. I was like “Cool, babe, works for me!” 

We did the whole Camelot thing in a daylight studio. A big deal with hair, makeup, styling, painted backdrop, falling rose petals, fake blood on the sword, catering, crew, managers, hangers-on. Everything.All the while her manager is heating up about how late it’s getting. I was like, “You brought her late, okay?” 

Finally he explodes and says “Gotta go now and the subway is the only way” (it was rush hour in New York and she had a gig in Jersey, “Get on the subway in the armor?" And she said, ’Yeah, that sounds about right!’” 

I shout for a camera, wide lens, hot shoe flash, green and magenta gels and a bunch of 100 speed 35 chrome.We bolt and slip her through the turnstiles–sword and all–unnoticed, Subway came right away and I started ripping film like crazy for 5 stops. On the train, New Yorkers, true to form avoided eye contact.

The studio shot went away and the subway shot (flash on camera, 1/15 of a second at F4, a hand held mess of a photograph) ran as the lead.

You never know."
