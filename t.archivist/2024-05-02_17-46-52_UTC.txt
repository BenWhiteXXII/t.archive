During the 1982 Lebanese war with Israel journalists were given shirts with “Don’t Shoot” written in English, French, and Arabic as a way to help protect them from being wrongfully killed by any of the innumerable factions. 

In 2017 designer Khalid Qasimi reworked the shirt as a commentary on rising tensions on the Middle East.

Again, in 2019, Georgian-born designer Demna Gvasalia also used the design for the Vetements 2020 S/S collection. Arguably in worst taste. 

1/2 were taken in Beirut, 1982. Last is a photo of the Vetements replica.
