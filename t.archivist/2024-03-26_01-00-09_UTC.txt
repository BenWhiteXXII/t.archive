Karin Mack- "White Shadows On Black Snow," 1982. 
Affected after seeing a woman die from being hit by a car- noticing the spray the victim's white hair, the glean of the sun, her accessories of life bursting across the pavement from a broken suitcase, Karin saw these items imbue what was left of the woman's life into themselves like a dreamcatcher. White Shadows on Black Snow. 
Dying usually happens elsewhere, separated, delivered up in hospitals sometimes unhealthy and dangerous. But there is a sterile seclusion, for the awareness of death is a danger.

But death has to be admitted to get in touch with life.

Life and death may be represented by the idea of light and shadow. Upon which photography is based. Karin, by using negative prints instead of positive images, draws attention to what is typically left unrevealed. The form of an object instead of its texture, this also draws away from details of what is captured and instead towards the entire general picture. These negative images contain only fragments of reality, a white shadow of life upon a black background of what is real.

Scanned by me. As far as I am aware this is the first time these photographs have been digitized.
