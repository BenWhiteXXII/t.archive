Aubrey Beardsley's illustrations for Oscar Wilde's play "Salome" 1894. 

The play was based upon the biblical legend of John the Baptist and Salome's attempt to seduce him, her dance of the seven veils, his beheading at Salome's instigation, and then her death at King Herod's hand.

Beardsley worked with a charming and theatrical style for his illustrations, inspired by Islamic and ancient Greek art. His characters, reflecting their morals, are noticeably emasculated and grotesque yet shaped and firm. He referred to his drawing as "naughty". 
Edward Gorey, another favorite illustrator of mine, nearly a century later critiqued these illustrations saying: 
“Illustrations shouldn’t be smaller than the book— that’s why you couldn’t possibly illustrate Jane Austen. At the same time, they shouldn’t be larger. Aubrey Beardsley‘s drawings for Salomé make Oscar Wilde seem in a way idiotic. The drawings are so powerful they create their own world, and one more interesting than Mr. Wilde’s. They are a perfectly terrible job of illustration, demolishing the text they are attached to.”
