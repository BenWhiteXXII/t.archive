A kind review written on a house in Serbia after the NATO bombings, 1999. 

Starting on March 24, 1999, NATO forces, led by the United States of America, initiated an air war against Serbia in an effort to put an end to the human rights abuses that were then being perpetrated against the ethnic Albanian population in Kosovo, which was sparked by many things but specifically a history of conflict between ethnic Albanians and Serbians as well as the recent actions of a US-backed ethnic separatist movement of namely gangsters and drug dealers, the KLA (Kosovo Liberation Army), which had been on and off internationally considered a terrorist group in the years before. 
At least 2500 Serbian civilians were killed by NATO's bombs. Although the potential estimates of "missing" ethnic Albanians is consideredconsidered far higher.
