"The Ladder of Divine Ascent" Is a 12th-century Icon by an unknown iconographer that represents the monastic theological teachings of John Climacus, also known as John Of The Ladder, who lived and died in the 6th and 7th centuries at the foot of Mount Sinai in Egypt. 

The Icon itself visually represents monks ascending a ladder, becoming closer to Christ who welcomes them with open arms. As monks ascend demons attempt to pull them off into the jaws of hell with nooses and arrows. Even monks closer to the top are liable to be drawn into sin. Shown to the bottom right are all the monks together upon earth. The top left shows the angels watching and praying for the monks.

His writings, often regarded also as "The Ladder of Divine Ascent" or "Scala Paradisi," lays the instructions and groundwork for a monk or nun to achieve "Theosis", aka reaching as much sinlessness and closeness to God as is possible for a living Human. The book is split into thirty chapters (or rungs), that each impart wisdom that is crucial for Orthodox and Coptic monasticism. 

The apparent dark thematic nature of this Icon is not strange for Orthodox Christian spirituality and teachings, which say that everyone must guard themselves against sin at all times and that even the most outwardly holy man can fall into sin. 

This specific Icon is located at Saint Catherine's Monastery in Sinai, Egypt.
