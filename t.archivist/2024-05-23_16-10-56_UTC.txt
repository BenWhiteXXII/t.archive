In the early 90s my grandparents got approval to start a new Orthodox Church where they lived. It was called ‘Holy Cross’ and it’s in Lithicum, Maryland. If you are from DC or Baltimore and are Orthodox you may have visited or heard of it.

One of the parishioners was a reporter for a major newspaper and had recently made a lot of noise about a local business being a secret mafia front. My grandmother, who was friends with this woman was driving through town one day and found herself driving right by the business, completely empty with its windows covered with boards. My grandmother had a funny idea and snapped a Polaroid and wrote on the back “you wrecka my business i wrecka you face”. She then drove to the reporter’s house and placed it in her mailbox. 

Two days later she was driving through the reporter’s neighborhood again for some unknown reason and saw it littered with federal agents and black vans. When she asked what was going on she was told “A serious threat has been placed in your friend’s life. A Polaroid of an abandoned mafia front was left in her mailbox with a threating message. We are investigating and might have to take them temporarily into witness protection.” 
Obviously my grandmother owned up to her prank and apologized but it took a while to convince them of the serious lack of severity.
