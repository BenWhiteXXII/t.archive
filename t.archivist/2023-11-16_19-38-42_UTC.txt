"Bear Dogs" by Dennis Loxton.
The Great Pyrenees is a breed of guard dog  used by silviculture workers in Canada to herd, guard, and protect sheep as well as their owners from bear attacks, usually to great success. 
These silvicultural workers will take herds of sheep hundred of kilometers into the wilderness to graze, usually into places no man has knowingly stepped before.
