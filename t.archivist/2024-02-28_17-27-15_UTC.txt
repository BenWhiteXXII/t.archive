Hokkaido sika buck with the head of a former rival on its antlers, Hokkaido Japan. Taken Valentine's Day, 2021, by Keiko Kanasugi.

Two sparring bucks got their antlers inseparably stuck during the autumn rutting season, eventually the weaker of the two died and the stronger would have had to drag the rivals dead body, which most likely weighed at least 100 kg, as he foraged for food while winter set in. A few weeks in the rivals body began to decay enough for the head to be separated. The winning deer probably did not mate at all because of this. 

Kanasugi said the scenes reminded her “of the harshness of nature and the heroism of the stag’s life.”

“With the rival's head stuck in its antlers, it’s as if he is wearing a trophy.”

If the deer is unable to shake off the severed head, it will have to survive until it sheds its antlers before spring.
