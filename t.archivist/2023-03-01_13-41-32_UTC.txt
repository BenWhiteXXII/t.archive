Leonard Cohen's tiny house he bought in 1960 on the Greek island of Hydra. 

Cohen bought the house for $1500, an inheritance from his grandmother, and decided to change as little about it as possible, not even adding electricity or running water. The only significant change was the addition of a 'music room' (first picture)

Cohen first recounted his interest in visiting Greece in a 1991 interview. It was 1960 when he found himself wandering the streets of rainy London. “I saw the door of a branch office of the Bank of Greece. I went inside and I saw the tanned cashier behind the counter. I asked him ‘What’s the weather like in Greece?’ And he replied, ‘It’s spring.’ Two days later, I left for Greece.”
