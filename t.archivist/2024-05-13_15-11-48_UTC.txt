“The Christian faith was adopted in the 4th century AD by King Ezana in the ancient Kingdom of Askum, making the cross a revered symbol of Christianity in Ethiopia. Known as “Meskel”-መስቀል in Ge’ez. Ethiopian crosses are categorized into staff, shafted, hand, & pendant crosses. Pendant crosses are smaller crosses typically worn as religious jewelry.

Ethiopian crosses are renowned for their distinctive shape & intricate lattice-like patterns of endless interwoven lines symbolizing eternity. They reflect a fusion of ancient Christian traditions & local artistic styles. They vary regionally in design and are named after the Ethiopian regions or towns where they originated. The main styles include Axum, Gondar, Lalibala, Desse, Shewa, Welega, Mekelle, Dese, and Gurage. These crosses have been influenced by various cultures such as Greek, Latin, Coptic, Celtic, and European.

In this photo series, we showcase Ethiopian Pendant crosses paired with regional attire from Gondar, Axum, Gurage, Welega, and Lalibela. Each cross carries its own unique history and symbolism, reflecting the rich cultural heritage of Ethiopia. We have tried to elevate the artistic beauty & unique radiance of each piece and create interplays between light & shadow, contrasting material presence and absence, and juxtaposing materiality and immateriality.”
