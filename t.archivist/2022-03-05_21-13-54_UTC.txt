Mahpiya Ska (Sioux for White Cloud).  Was a true albino buffalo, who lived from July 10, 1996 - November 14, 2016.

She primarily lived under the care of the Nation Buffalo Museum in Jamestown, North Dakota. As most albino bison she was mostly deaf and had very poor eyesight, yearly costs to take care of her were around 10,000 as well. 

Yearly, thousands of Indigenous Americans would take pilgrimages to visit her and tie ribbons to the fence around the land she grazed. 

Over the years she has several calves and in 2007 she gave birth to her only white offspring.

She died in the November of 2016 after being returned to the same herd she had been born into.
