Redfoo from LMFAO riding on top of a live JDAM at Incirlik Air Base in 2011(?). According to a follower who claims they were stationed at this base, and present when this happened: Redfoo had just finished some sort of tour and was invited to the base in order to boost morale. The reason why they painted the JDAM was because the base didn't have any sort of stage or decorations so they painted a spare missile with cardboard stencils+ spray paint. While being given a tour of the base Redfoo saw the bomb and jumped right on top of it with zero hesitation, but nobody wanted to tell him that it was still live (as indicated by the yellow band). The bomb was later dropped as is. 

Any party rockets in the air tonight?
