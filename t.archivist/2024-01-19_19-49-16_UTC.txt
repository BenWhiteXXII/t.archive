A young couple at the end of the Romanian Revolution, December, 1989.

 The revolution overthrew the Communist dictatorship that had terrorized the citizens, and ended with Nicola Ceausescu and his wife being executed. The carnations in the gun barrels are supposed to symbolize peace, probably a reference to the Portuguese 'Carnation Revolution' that overthrew Marcelo Caetano and his regime in 1974.
