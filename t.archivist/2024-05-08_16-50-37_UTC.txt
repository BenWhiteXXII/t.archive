RIP Steve Albini, who died of a heart attack today. Possibly the greatest producer of all time, having worked on over 200 releases. This is particularly harrowing because his band, Shellac had been preparing to tour their first album in a decade, “To All Trains”, which is scheduled for release next week. He was 61 years old.
