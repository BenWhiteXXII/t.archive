Jonathan Frid crowns Christine Domaniecki "Miss American Vampire" 1970.
This was a promotional gimmick on the part of MGM for the "Dark Shadows" feature film "House of Dark Shadows," the winner was to be awarded a trip to New York and a guest spot on the TV series.  Weirdly, Sacheen Littlefeather -- later to appear at the Oscars three years later to decline Marlon Brando's award for "The Godfather" on his behalf -- would take the final crown, but ultimately never claim the grand prize, Domaniecki appearing on the series instead and became the technical winner.
