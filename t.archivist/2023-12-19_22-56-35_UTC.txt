ANNOUNCEMENT!
This Friday, the 22nd, I will be running a stall at @market_hugs with @faun.fawn for our "bookstore" @pinakotheca_.
We will have many many rare curated photobooks, zines, records, posters, and even a few cool vintage shirts at really good prices! 

So if you live in the area come down to Little Five Points in Atlanta this Friday between 1pm and 6pm and say hello and maybe spend a lot of money on us or maybe some of the dozens of other awesome vendors!
