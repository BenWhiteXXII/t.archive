Before and after a lobotomy. 

A lobotomy, or leucotomy, is a form of neurosurgical treatment for psychiatric disorder or some neurological disorders. 
The surgery works by cutting connections in the brain's prefrontal cortex.

What a lobotomy would do is not necessarily cure schizophrenia or OCD In a patient but make them easier to handle and a lot calmer. 

Lobotomies were performed on women to a greater extent then on men.
