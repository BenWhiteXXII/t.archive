"Võ Thị Thắng, a Vietcong rebel and Communist, smiles after being sentenced 20 years hard labor for an attempted assassination on a spy. Reportedly she said to the jury after he sentencing, "20 years? Will your government even last long enough for me to serve it?"
Less than 6 years later she was set free as part of the Paris Peace Accords and went on to continually serve in the Vietnamese government in multiple statuses and positions up until 2006. 

Happy International Woman's day!
