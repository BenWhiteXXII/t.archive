A heart-shaped meadow created by an English farmer as a tribute to his deceased wife. Near Wickwar, South Gloucestershire. 

The Meadow contains 6,000 oak trees in a six-acre field and the heart points towards Wotton Hill, the childhood home where his wife was born and raised. There's also a field of daffodils planted in the center which bloom during spring.

"I came up with the idea of creating a heart in the clearing of the field after Janet died… I thought it was a great idea – it was a flash of inspiration – and I planted several thousand oak trees.

Once it was completed we put a seat in the middle, overlooking the hill near where she used to live. I sometimes go down there, just to sit and think about things. It is a lovely lasting tribute which will be here for years.” 

The tribute was actually unknown by all until a hot air balloonist noticed the heart from an aerial view and decided to ask the farmer about it.
