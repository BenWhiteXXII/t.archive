Sachiko Kanenobu (1948-??) is regarded as a hidden gem among fans of contemporary folk and Japanese music alike.
Born to a musically-inclined family, Sachiko picked up a guitar just as the "Kansai folk-boom" swept colleges in the mid-60s. 
In 1968 she was signed to Japan's very first independent record label, URC.  She found difficulty recording and producing her music, until Haroumi Hosono, a member of the band Happy End, offered to help.
Over a period of seven days Sachiko worked on her debut album, Misora, with many of the songs being recorded in a single take. but a few months before her album was released she secreted immigrated to california to marry music critic Paul Williams.
Without an artist to promote her album the release fell into obscurity and was forgotten by all, including Sachiko, who was happily raising two young boys in a small town in the coast.
In the early 80s a friend of her's, author Philip K. Dick, gifted her money and suggested that she'd write some songs in English and release them, the resulting single was pressed privately but never became commercial. Despite all the encouragement she got with her music she never took it as seriously as anyone else. 

As of a couple days ago her album Misora is now available for streaming on the west, so I suggest checking it out.
