"Miles just called and says he wants his album to be titled: 'Bitches Brew' please advise"

Memo from Ted Macero to Columbia Records execs,  November of 1969, up until this point everyone involved believed the album was to be called "Listen To This," but then Miles Davis called with a name change. Presumably the memoâ€™s recipients advised Macero to simply accept the demand, and four months later Miles' jazz opus was released, to critical acclaim and a punch of memorability.
