Che Guevara smoking a cigar, reading Goethe's Faust, and snuggling up with a puppy deep in the Sierra Maestra during the Cuban Revolution.

In his 1961 military handbook, "Guerrilla Warfare," Che Guevara would recommend reading as a method of combating ennui. While he specifically recommends nonfiction- “good biographies of past heroes, histories, or economic geographies"- as it would help distract from vices such as alcohol and gambling. Non-fiction was also still very popular among the guerrilla fighters, many of which were college educated, with Che and Castro respectively being a doctor and a lawyer. 
One big hit was Curzio Malaparte’s "The Skin," a novel recounting the brutality of the occupation of Naples after World War II. And, ever convinced of a victory, Fidel thought having his fighters read the book would help ensure that the men would behave well when they captured Havana.

Of course the intense bibliophilia of these men sometimes danced into fanaticism, With at one point Che almost being killed in an air raid because he was pouring over a copy of Edward Gibbon’s "The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire."
