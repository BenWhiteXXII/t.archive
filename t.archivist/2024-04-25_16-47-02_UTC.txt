Weegee and Bettie Page. 

Weegee, one of the pioneers of modern photojournalism, grew a close personal friendship with the burlesque and pinup model Bettie Page. For years they lived less than a 5-minute walk from each other in Times Square. In fact there's a story that Weegee climbed into a tub with her to get a better photo and she literally kicked him out. 

Weegee's photography of Bettie Page was never printed in his lifetime, as his personal photographic angle was typically a lot different than from most men who photographed her. Not just focusing on her but the entire environment of the studio, such as the second slide, where he reveals an entire flock of desperate photographers. At this time in Bettie's career photographs of her were highly sought after, but one with another man would have been worthless. 

Because of obscenity laws during the '50s Bettie and the photographers around her were constantly hounded by the FBI. Once being called by the Kefauver Committee in conjunction with their investigation of Irving Klaw, and earlier in relation to an obscenity bust in 1956 Harlem in which the amateur bondage model was asked about "ping pong paddles" and a riding crop. She denied being involved, and also denied knowing of any photographs of the sort being produced in Harlem.

In some recently released FBI documents, It appears that some point in the early '60s they got to Weegee as well, who turned in photos he took.
