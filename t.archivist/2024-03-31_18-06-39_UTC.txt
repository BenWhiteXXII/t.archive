In 1959 Vladimir Demikhov, a Soviet scientist and organ transplant pioneer, attached the upper body of a small dog to the neck of a large dog. The small dog was a nine year old female named Shavka and the large male dog who was a stray picked up in the streets by a dog catcher was named Brodyaga.

By the time the news of the operation hit America in 1959, the surgeon - Vladimir Demikhov, 43 at the time - had already been performing transplants on dogs for five years. Having performed a total of 24 of these surgeries, typically with lifespans afterwards ranging from 4 days to an entire month. Both dogs were also being able to see, hear, smell, and swallow, from as early as his first experiment, in 1954. 

His earliest work involved heart and lung transplants, and was the first person to write a monograph on organ transplants.
The ultimate aim of his research was for organ transplantations to be implemented in clinical practice on humans. Thanks to his typically levelheaded demeanor and willingness to answer questions from western scientists the public opinion towards human organs transplants became much more accepting. In 1967 a South African doctor performed the first successful human heart surgery and credited Dr Demikhov's early work for making it possible.

This post has photos from two two-headed dog experiments, one being from 1955 as well.
