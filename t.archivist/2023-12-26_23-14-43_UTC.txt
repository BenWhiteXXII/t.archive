For the unenlightened, an Orgone Accumulator is a box made from natural and manmade materials layered over in order to capture "Orgone" within it, based on the writings of Wilhelm Reich. Orgone, also known as "Life Force" or "Libido," would be concentrated in this box, and the user would sit inside and absorb higher than normal amounts, leading to high energy, better overall health, as well as heightened sexuality. Burroughs would sit inside of this machine for hours at a time, and despite his decades of drug abuse, he lived to 83.
