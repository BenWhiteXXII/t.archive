"through a lobotomy, an insane person turns into an idiot,"- New York Times.  1953

Some graphics from medical books and magazines showing the difference between before and after receiving a lobotomy. 

In the 1940s and '50s neuroscience was far less developed than it was today, tens of thousands of lobotomies were performed, sometimes without the consent or knowledge of the individual, despite it more or less being an experimental procedure that didn't even meet the required evidence to suggest that it guaranteed and improve in quality of life. For a while it was praised as an answer to an unfixable condition, But many doctors still proclaimed it to be a violation of Hippocratic Oath. Sometimes people would "relapse" and have to get a second procedure. 
Unfortunately, there were no known alternatives to treating schizophrenia until 1954 when chlorpromazine was introduced.
