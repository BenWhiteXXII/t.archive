7, 8. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre by Tobe Hooper (1974). "When asked about his biggest influences on the film, Hooper surprisingly responded by saying "Christina's World" by Andrew Wyeth. It's a 1948 painting by the American artist which currently resides in the Museum Of Modern Art in New York. Just one glimpse at the piece below totally shows how it encapsulates the movie."

9. The painting is referenced in Ethel Cain's music video for the 2022 song "American Teenager." @mothercain
