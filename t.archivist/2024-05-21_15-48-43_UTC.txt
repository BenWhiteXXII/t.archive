When my mother was around 11 she woke up blind, her face swollen shut from a sudden fluke of life, having developed an allergy to poison ivy somehow overnight. The previous night she must have accidentally rubbed some of the oils the leaves secreted into her eyes when she was weeding the garden. It took a few days for the swelling to totally go down but in the end everything was fine.
Decades later when she gave birth to my brother the doctors said he was neurologically blind. Nothing physically wrong with his eyes, but somehow the connection to his brain wasn’t working. About forty days later, on the day of his baptism, my mother states he gained his sight. His eyes reacted to light, and would focus on things in front of him instead of staring into dead space. He can still see to this very day. 
And me? I don’t feel so good.
