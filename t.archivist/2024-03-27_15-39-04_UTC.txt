Nirvana photographed with a few Jenny Holzer truisms, taken by Stephen Sweet, 1993.

"In the days leading up to the shoot I had seen this slogan on a cinema in the middle of the street between 7th and 8th Avenues and thought that If I could get Kurt to see it, he might be alright for me using it as part of the background. He saw it and said 'take my picture in front of that' so I obliged. 

If the band had any idea it was part of a Jenny Holzer installation, they did not mention it. I had no idea either. I have since learned the central nature of her work seems to be all about anonymity, no explanations beyond the words themselves. No handy guide about why it was there, just the face value of the words staged. 10 years earlier, in Amsterdam, I had seen “Abuse Of Power Comes As No Surprise” on a jetty at the water level in the port. Again, no explanations. It stuck with me. I thought it was to do with the spirit of the city and its supposed enlightened viewpoint. The cinemas in New York had the same feeling, strong, immediate slogans."- Stephen Sweet.
