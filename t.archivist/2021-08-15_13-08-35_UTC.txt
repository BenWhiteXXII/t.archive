The camera operators are told in advance when they're going to be cut to or at least given a heads-up, so this guy assumed he was safe to use his camera basically as a pair of binoculars bc he wasn't supposed to get the focus. But the person who was switching between camera feeds accidentally cut to his camera by mistake instead of the one that was supposed to be filming, so they ended up televising what was supposed to me one man's private cockroach observation moment.
