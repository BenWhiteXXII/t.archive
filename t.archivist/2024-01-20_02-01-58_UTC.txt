Li Binyuan, a "self-unemployed artist" from Beijing, sprints or races a moped while nude through Beijing, carrying either a wooden cross or a sex doll because he was "bored" and "was only trying to let off steam." March 11, 2011.

Li Binyuan dismisses any claims that his acts were political in nature, saying that he never intended for so many people to see him. Also stating that he would go on such runs whenever he felt extremely stressed, and that after he felt much more connected with the world.
City Police said they had no intention of persecuting him because whenever he would run naked through the city it would be typically between 2:00 and 5:00 in the morning with very few people awake.
