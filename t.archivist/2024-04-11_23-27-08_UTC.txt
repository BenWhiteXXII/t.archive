Eglė Rakauskaitė- 'In Honey' 1996.

 The artist lays curled in a fetal position upon a cotton sheet, stretched across a platform, partly submerged in honey. Honey plays a large role in the Lithuanian national cultural identity. It is not only a symbolic cultural product, but is also used for its medicinal and healing purposes. Furthermore, it was the performance artist Joseph Beuys who acknowledged the mystical properties of honey – a product made from what he saw as the model of a "perfect community": bees. In Egle’s piece, honey becomes the amniotic fluid, and the artist is able to breathe through a tube that effectively becomes her umbilical cord. Essentially through this performance Rakauskaite reenacts a rebirth or baptism with honey being the sacred medium instead of embryonic fluid or holy water.
