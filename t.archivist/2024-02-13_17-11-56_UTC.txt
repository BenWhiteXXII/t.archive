Mike Parr, Blood Box, 1998.

A 24-hour performance where the artist, Mike Parr, represents the bride as a "liminal figure in an exchange economy," representing the distancing from the social, or the liminality of the exchange itself. The performance offers no solution. Parr is known for his bizarre and semi violent performance pieces, often with the use of blood. 

"our bastard cultures need bastard forms"

Accompanying text that came with photo publications of this performance:

Blood Box: A man enters the space, he’s dressed as a bride, white dress, full regalia. S/he sits on a chair, a medico comes and extracts blood from a vein, it siphons into a plastic medical-like receptacle. The bride is sleep deprived, s/he hasn’t slept for 24 hours, s/he looks tired. S/he enters a glass chamber via a ladder, up and over the top and down the other side, the ladder is extracted, s/he is alone, contained. The collected blood is handed to the bride who squirts it around the glass walls of her cell, creating a red liquid veil that pools in the corners of the enclosure. She lays down, at last to sleep. Visitors come and go, they look into the glass cube, through a screen of blood they see the man-bride sleeping.
