“To my amazement I have heard that there are people who have never seen a gnome. I can’t help pitying these people. I am certain there must be something wrong with their eyesight.”
-Axel Munthe, Swedish psychiatrist, 1857-1949

Illustrations by Will Huygen from his 1977 book "Gnomes". 

Growing up my mother had an original English edition and I would spend countless hours leafing through in amazingment. Gnomes are real.
