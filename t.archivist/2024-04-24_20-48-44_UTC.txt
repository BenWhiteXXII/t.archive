As a promotional stunt for Aphex Twin's 1996 "Richard D James Album", genuine locks of Richard's hair were sent with the first 100 copies, most, if not all, of these were promotional copies sent out before the public release of the album.
In a Dutch magazine, several months before the albums release, Richard teased the idea by saying: 

"The first 100 copies of ‘Richard D James’ will be sent out with a piece of hair. At first I wanted to send pieces of my beard but at the very last moment I realised I had already sent my beard previously”

Copies of the album with a lock of hair almost never show up on the second hand market, to the point that until 2021 no pictures of this had ever been posted online.
