French police confiscate DJ equipment after breaking up an illegal rave, 2021. 
About 400 officers were sent to break up the event which held about 1,500 people in attendance. The police ended up throwing charge clusters and tear gas at the group who retaliated by throwing Molotov cocktails, rocks, and metal balls. The fight lasted seven hours with many people injured and even a 22-year-old losing his hand. The rave was held in remembrance of a French DJ who was inadvertently killed by the police at a rave in 2019.
