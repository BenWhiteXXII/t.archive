Pavlik Manukyan, a legendary Armenian war hero, gets married in the midst of the first Nagorno-Karabakh war, early 90s. 

In 2016 Manukyan led an armed group called the "Daredevils of Sassoun" who led a multi-day hostage bargain after they invaded a Yerevan police station demanding that president Serzh Sargsyan resign, and that a new Armenian government should be formed. Eventually they allowed themselves to be arrested claiming that they had started the spark that would create change. Their actions did influence tens of thousands of protesters to support their cause. At his trial Pavlik said to the judge:
"My wife has never seen me defeated, And I will die on that altar."
