Sentinels of the Arctic: Lapland’s Frozen Forests.

During the six coldest months of the year, when the dawn rarely cracks, but instead, the land is cast in the eternal dark and dawn, Finland’s nearly unpopulated Lapland region becomes a surreal cloak of icy snow. 
Much of Finland’s north is part of the semi-contiguous boreal forest, which stretches across much of the Arctic latitudes of the northern hemisphere. This winter forest, or taiga, is the world’s largest terrestrial biome, and when temperatures drop to -15 or -35 degrees Celsius these forests and lakes become frozen in time. 
The air is often humid, yet not truly dry. Invisible rain crystals fall from the sky and freeze to everything they touch, curling the branches of trees downward, and posing a threat to any unprepared traveler.
