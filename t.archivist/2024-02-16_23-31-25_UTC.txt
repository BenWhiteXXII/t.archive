“From a Window” by Masahisa Fukase, 1974. Photos taken by Fukase of his wife, Yoko, leaving their apartment every day for an entire summer.

For the 13 years they were married (from 1963 till 1976) Fulase almost photographed her exclusively. 

Yoko claimed the time they spent together were moments of “suffocating dullness interspersed by violent and near suicidal flashes of excitement." 
 She also cited photography as a barrier that came between them. “In the ten or so years of our marriage, he has only seen me through the lens of a camera, never without. And in fact what he saw through the lens was not me, but nothing other than himself.” 

When Yoko left him in 1976, Fukase began drinking heavily and suffered bouts of debilitating depression. In the immediate months after her departure, he famously photographed ravens he saw at train stations on his way home to Hokkaido with the same single-minded intensity that he had photographed her.

 Yoko was just the longest in many failed relationships, and after each relationship breakdown, Fukase would experience an existential crisis that questioned his very being. “Taking photographs does not make you a photographer, and living doesn’t make you alive. At the end of the day, who am I, really?” he wrote. 

Fukase's death followed twenty years in a coma, after falling down the stairs of his favourite bar, "Nāmi, in 1992.  Yōko visited him twice a month during this period, although he may never have been aware of her presence.
