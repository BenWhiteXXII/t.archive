Kohei Yoshiyuki, "Park." 1971-1973. 

Brisking the lines between what it means to be a voyeur, participant, and onlooker, Yoshiyuki secretly captured with a special infrared camera not only the couples who would copulate within the nighttime darkness of Shinjuku, Yoyogi, and Aoyama parks in Tokyo but also the peeping toms who were watching them. These Illicit spectators of nocturnal coitus being the true subject of his photography. This scene was possible as  through the '70s sexual libertines of all orientations would nightly glide through Tokyo's parks and bushes with their lovers, making the ideal spot for young couples to have an intimate experience, and this was often accentuated by the awareness of other couples who were doing the same thing around them, although not aware of the interlopers who were also fulfilling their own secret sexual desires with them. 

When he exhibited his photography in 1979, he laid huge prints upon the walls of a pitch-black basement and gave viewers torches and flashlights to see the spectacle.  Many of these photos show men, crawling like soldiers through thickets towards unsuspecting couples. The voyeurs would come up slowly behind the man and pretend to be him when they touched the woman. She often didn't realize anything... and neither would the man. 

British photographer Martin Parr summarised it as follows: "The Park captures the loneliness, sadness, and despair that accompanies human and sexual relationships in the great, rough metropolis that is Tokyo..."
