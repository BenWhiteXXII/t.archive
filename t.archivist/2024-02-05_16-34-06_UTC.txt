GOOOOOOD MOOOORNING🗡️ ZOMBIE SPIDERS IN MY BASEMENT!!!!! ✨ ⭐

To everyone else, GM I guess.... 😒

Cellar spiders, often because of the damp environment they inhabit, are prone to being infected by a unique fungus that invades their body and slowly takes over. During early stages of the infection these spiders will wander around in a zombie-like state, but eventually the fungus will eat all of the spider's tissue, killing them.
