Saddam Hussein uses a gun to flirt with his cousin, Sajida Talfah, who would become his future wife, 1958.
While Sajida bore five children to Saddam, she typically stayed out of the public eye and the people knew little of her existence. In 1986, Saddam unexpectedly married a second wife, Samira Shahbandar, which angered many family members- Including Sajida and Saddam's first born son, Uday, who stabbed to death a bodyguard who he believed had introduced the two and subsequently put his inheritance at risk. Despite Saddam having married a third woman in 1990 as well, Sajida did not separate from him and even helped organize his legal defense in 2003. Allegedly she is still alive today.
