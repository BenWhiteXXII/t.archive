Santisuk, Thailand’s Monkey Police, 2010.

Santisuk, Thai for ‘peace’, was a five-year-old pig-tailed macaque monkey who was found injured and then was adopted by local policemen. As part of his duties Santisuk would be dressed in uniform on patrol every day to help improve the force’s image and relations with the population in the troubled predominantly Muslim province of Yala. 

Unfortunately Santisuk was killed by dogs September of that year (two days before retirement) and the force was gifted a new macaque by a villager out of sympathy. The state of the newer monkey is unknown.
