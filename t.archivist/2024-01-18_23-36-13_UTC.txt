The Cro Cop story, an early 2000s television documentary about Mirko FilipoviÄ‡ better known by his ring name Mirko Cro Cop, a retired Croatian professional mixed martial artist, kickboxer and amateur boxer, widely considered one of the greatest Heavyweight Kickboxers and MMA fighters of all time.
The full documentary with English subtitles is available on YouTube. Highly recommended from my end.
