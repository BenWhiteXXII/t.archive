The “Braiding the Knoll” project was made by Angela Eastman during a two-year fellowship at Penland School of Crafts in the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina. The project took a week to complete, as Eastman braided a rim of circles. She says that as she worked, it became an exercise of observation, “in allowing my thoughts to quiet enough to hear the grass rustling under my hands, notice the incredible variety of pattern and color in the field, smell the earth baking in the heat of early summer” 

The project was an exemplifcation of humans connection to the land. We benefit from natures abundances, yet we destroy it and take it for granted. This was demonstrated at the end when the grass braid was mown 2 weeks after it was completed.
