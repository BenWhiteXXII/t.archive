YMO in New York, by Nan Goldin, 1993. 

Taken over a period of two few weeks as the artists became familiar with each other. Initially, the members of YMO were so shy that they couldn't even look Nan Goldin in the eye but eventually a mutual respect took hold which allowed Nan Goldin to take these incredible photographs.

"As I am not Japanese, I don't have the same attachment to them as a Japanese person might have. For me they seemed to be just three shy men. Because I am also shy, but in a different way, it was our fortune that we met each other on an equal level without being held back by each other's reputations in different countries. 

 What I captured in my photographs were Mr.Takahashi's incredible fashion sense and the gentleness found in his modest and unobtrusive gestures; Mr. Hosono's spiritual quality and serenity; Mr. Sakamoto's ability of appreciating another artist's talent while allowing room for their ability to shine."
