"ANGER IS OUR DAILY BREAD: Student Struggles and Protest"- Tatsuo Kurihara, 1969.

Throughout much of the '60s student protests we're constantly ongoing throughout Japan, and usually were in relation to an ever-changing cycle of issues whether that be Anpo protests against the 'United States / Japan Security Treat', or other protests against unpaid internships, university corruption, or reaction towards the death of a student at the hands of police.

In 1968 Zenkyoto, or "All-Campus Joint 
-Struggle Committees", began forming across universities, consisting of anti-government individuals, leftists who were anti-Japanese Communist Party, and other radicals. Typically unified by a stance against American imperialism, stalinism, and "monopoly capitalism". 

This book consists of photographs taken of these protests by the photo journalist Tatsuo Kurihara.

164 pages, 26x18 cm, softcover, printed by "Toju-sha".
