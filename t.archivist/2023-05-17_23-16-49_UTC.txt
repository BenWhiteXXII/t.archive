John Wojtowicz poses at the Brooklyn branch Chase Bank that he robbed in 1972 in an attempt to fund sexual reassignment surgery for his lover. 
He carried his role with flair, throwing wads of cash at onlookers, demanding food for hostages who weren't even frightened of him. 
When "Dog Day Afternoon" came out, inspired by these events, he paid for his partner's sexual reassignment surgery from prison with the money he got from selling the rights to his story.
