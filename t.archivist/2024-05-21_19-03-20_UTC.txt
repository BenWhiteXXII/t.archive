St Michael the Archangel, patron saint of the Greek / Hellenic Air Force+ St George slaying the dragon mock up designs for the Greek Airforce. 
As far as I can tell these unfortunately were never used and were made probably in photoshop as an example of “nose art” that could be adopted. Probably for non warfare events.
