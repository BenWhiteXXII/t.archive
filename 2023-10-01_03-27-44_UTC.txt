GUN, "Event to Change the Image of Snow," 1970. 
For a few blissful minutes on February 11, 1970, four members of the Japanese art collective Group Ultra Niigata (known as GUN), with permission from the local government, dashed across a dry bank of the Shinano River in the small town of Tōkamachi, blasting bright pigments onto the snow with fertilizer sprayers. Half an hour later, fresh snowflakes reset the scene. Tōkamachi had been receiving intense amounts of snow year-round, which, slowing life, and creating gloom for the residents. There was no audience present to appreciate the transformation of the dreary landscape, but the ephemeral painting performance came to be known as 'Event to Change the Image of Snow'. We are only aware of it today because of the photojournalists Hanaga Mitsutoshi and Iso Toshikazu, who tagged along to capture the event.
