Stubbs the Cat, Mayor of Talkeetna, Alaska, 1997-2017.

Stubbs was elected Mayor of Talkeetna, a Historical District/Town of  around 800 people who didn't see the need of a functional Mayor. 
He would be visited and petted by around 30-40 visitors everyday who were passing through the town towards other parts of Alaska but stopped by in order to meet the Mayor.

Every afternoon, Stubbs went to a nearby restaurant and drank water laced with catnip out of a wineglass or a margarita glass.

In 2013 Stubbs was mauled terribly by a local dog but survived, the dog was put down.

Stubbs served his people from only a few months of age until his death, never once leaving his hometown, such was his dedication. God bless Stubbs the Cat.
