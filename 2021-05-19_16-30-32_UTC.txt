Not much is to be found online about Nobue Kawana, except that, living in coastal Japan she romanticized her own life- by writing songs about her love for the sea, sickness, and love itself. And that she had a singular album, entitled Nobue's Sea, in 1975.

Despite this, her childhood best friend, Keiko Saitou, still recounts: 

	“I met her first when I was 16. I would go over to her house all the time to sing and record music onto cassette tapes. She had perfect pitch and could play any instrument she touched- violin, guitar, and composition as well. I would harmonize with her, and play piano, as well as help with lyrics.

	My parents greatly disapproved of our friendship, they would scold me for not applying my every second to my studies. But I still spent much of my time practicing my abilities in songwriting and going over to her house to play.

	She was fashionable and influential to her friends in a positive sense. Despite a sickness that had wrecked her health since early teenhood.

	On her 19th birthday, in 1974, she passed away.

	I independently attempted to have a physical LP of her music released, and in 1975, it was done. With the help of a male mutual friend who told her life story in segments sandwiched between the tracks. These copies were given to our friend group as almost a parting gift for us all.

	I still think about how every day, after school, I would visit her in her room as she was always sick in bed because of the untreatable cancer. We sang of love, sickness, and a longing for the sea.”

In 2013 the rare album was re-issued by Branco Label on cd, with two extra tracks (there is most likely a lot more unreleased tapes).

Hopefully, if enough feedback is given to the label a vinyl re-issue could be made.
