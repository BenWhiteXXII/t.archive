SHOTS (1971) 
A collection of 100 photographs by revolutionary and underground photographers collected to demonstrate that there IS a rising and growing sense of revolution in America. 

A recent addition to my personal collection, you can easily find yourself a copy of this book for around 35-45 dollars.
