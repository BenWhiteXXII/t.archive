Camilo Torres Restrepo (3 February 1929,15 February 1966) was a Roman Catholic priest, socialist, a proponent of Liberation Theology, a member of the Columbian  National Liberation Army (ELN), and a guerilla fighter.
In 1960 he co-founded the Sociology Faculty together with Sociologist Orlando Fals Borda, as part of the academic staff of the National University of Colombia, and during that time he was active among many student and political movements that not only helped him gain a following outside of his church, but also many detractors who, many being from the Catholic Church, and Columbian government. Eventually, Camilo ended up going into hiding leaving behind has job as an academic, and joining a group of guerrilla fighters, offering spiritual assistance from the perspective of a marxist-christian. 
In one of his first direct combat experiences he was killed and eventually turned into a symbol of martyrdom for the ELN.
