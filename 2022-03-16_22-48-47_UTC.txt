St Herman of Alaska, the first Saint in North America. 
Born in 1754 somewhere near Moscow, Fr. Herman (whose very name is unknown before he entered the monastic life) was received by the great Troitski-Sergievsky Monastery at the age of 16, and later to Valaam Monastery. In 1793 he was among those who volunteered to form the Alaskan Mission, to Kodiak Island, at the request of a fur trading company, who asked for a priest to convert the Natives. 
The mission (ten different monks and deacons) landed at St. Paul’s Harbor, Kodiak, in September of 1794. Within a year, over 7,000 native Americans had been baptized, mostly Aleuts. 
Conflicts developed with the Russian-American Trading Company, over their terrible treatment and regular abuse of the Alaskan natives, whose rights the missionaries upheld and protected. In 1800 they were placed under house arrest and forbade contact with the natives. The next year, the missionaries administered the oath of allegiance to the Czar to the natives in an attempt to extend imperial protection to them. Threatened with violence, and some even martyred, the monks withdrew to their compound and refused to hold public services for a year. Between 1806 and 1818, Father Herman, steadfast in behalf of the natives, withdrew to Elovoi (Spruce) Island, where he built a cell and chapel; here he lived in prayer, nursing the sick, feeding the hungry, and ministering to the natives. In time he maintained a small school and orphanage. The island he renamed New Valaam in memory of his beloved Monastery. In 1823 a small church was built, dedicated to the “Meeting of Our Lord.” Tales of miracles, healing and the like surrounded him, in the tradition of the wonder-working saints of the Eastern Church. His reputation for holiness and simplicity of life spread abroad, attracting many pilgrims and visitors, including the great explorer, Bering. Father Herman died in 1837.
