Poster for Elem Klimovâ€™s now-classic masterpiece film Come and See is seen on a wall in Moscow, Soviet Union, in 1985. 

Interestingly, live ammunition was used in the film - in interviews, actor Aleksey Kravchenko (who was only 14 at the time of the filming) described actual bullets passing some 10 centimeters above his head. The director planned to have him hypnotized by a psychotherapist during the most dreadful and violent scenes so that they wouldn't affect his young mind.
Despite this, Aleksey's hair notably turned partially grey due to stress during this time.
