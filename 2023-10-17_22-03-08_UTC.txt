The Tuscany sword. A Tuscan knight named Galgano Guidotti plunged his sword into a rock in the year 1180. He then swore off war and became a hermit. According to legend, He began seeing visions of the Archangel Michael telling Giudotti to renounce all of his earthly possessions. Eventually he responded that this would be as difficult as splitting a stone, and to prove his point, thrust his sword into a rock. To his surprise, the sword went through the stone's surface as though it was water. Shortly after, an errant horse led Giudotti to the a hilltop that had appeared in his visions, where he was moved to plant a cross. Not having any wood handy, he plunged his sword into a rock, just as he had in the vision, where it was embedded. It is believed that this sword evolved into the Excalibur story in the UK (Sword in the stone & King Arthur). The sword remains embedded in the stone to this day.

For centuries, the sword was assumed to be a fake. But after examining the composition of the metal in 2001, researcher Luigi Garlaschelli confirmed that the "composition of the metal and the style are compatible with the era of the legend". The analysis also confirmed that the upper piece and the invisible lower one are authentic and belong to one and the same artifact. Ground-penetrating radar analysis also revealed that beneath the sword there is a cavity, about two meters by one meter, which is thought to be a burial recess, possibly containing the knight's body.
