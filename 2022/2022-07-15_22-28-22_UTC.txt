"The fiery young human rights activist fears she will be killed by drug barons and warlords who dominate the parliament in Afghanistan. During outspoken speeches and media interviews Joya (29) has attacked her fellow MPs for being corrupt and "no better than animals in a zoo." Her battle for women's rights and a more democratic government has made her many enemies in her own country, but her courage has been recognised by awards from human rights organisations around the world. On the 7th of October 2006, Russian investigative journalist, Anna Politkovskaya, was killed in Moscow. On the second anniversary of her murder at a ceremony at London's Frontline Club, the RAW (Reach All Women) in WAR Anna Politkovskaya Award will be presented to Malalai Joya, the courageous woman human rights defender from the war in Afghanistan. RAW in WAR (Reach All Women in WAR) is a new international human rights NGO supporting women human rights defenders working in countries of war and conflict and helping end abuse and persecution against them. Mariana Katzarova founded RAW in WAR in 2006, after working as a journalist and human rights advocate in the war zones of Bosnia, Kosovo and Chechnya, including 10 years as the Russia Researcher for Amnesty International."
