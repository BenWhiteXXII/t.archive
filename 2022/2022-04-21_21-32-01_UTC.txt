Elephants mining for salt under Mount Elgon on the Kenya-Uganda border.

The elephants use their tusks to break off pieces of the cave wall, which they then chew and swallow, leaving long scratch marks all over the cave walls. Each elephant can consume over ten kilograms of salty debris per visit, with some instances of over 20kg being seen.
