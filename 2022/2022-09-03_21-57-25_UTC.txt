Bea Camacho - Enclose, 2005. 

Enclose by Bea Camacho, a visual artist born in Manila, Philippines, and based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, is a performance art piece revolving around the art of knitting. Channeling her inner caterpillar, the Filipino artist created a cocoon out of red yarn over a period of 11 hours. Crocheting continuously without breaks, it is a feat of perseverance and patience. 

Yet Enclose by Bea Camacho deals with more than those driving forces. The artist writes on her website, "This video work deals with ideas of isolation, security, shelter and of shaping oneâ€™s own environment." Yet she also states in an interview, "To me, crochet is associated with home, warmth and security." So in a way, she is isolating herself in a protective cocoon that ensures she is not tainted by outside dangers.
