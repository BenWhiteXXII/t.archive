On this day, four years ago, Richard Russell, (Endearingly known as 'Sky King') stole a Bombardier Dash 8 Q400 Airliner from an airport he worked at in Seattle with zero previous flying experience.
While making contact with air traffic control he said he wanted to do a barrel roll, a seemingly impossible task for even a professional with a aircraft of this size, but pulled it off perfectly. 
During the 75 minute flight Russel apologized for his actions, stating he didn't want to hurt anyone, and overall came off as confused. 

"I'm just a broken guy, got a few screws loose, I guess, didn't really know it until now."

After refusing to attempt to land at a different airport, citing he didn't want to mess everything up, he would eventually intentionally crash into a remote island in Puget Sound, ending his life. 

After the incident, Horizon Air CEO Gary Beck described Russels aerial manuevers as 'incredible' 

Rest in Peace, Beebo
