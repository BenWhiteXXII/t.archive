Kyz Kuu (Azerbaijani for 'Girl chasing', but often known as 'kissing game). Is an equastrian game where two people, a young man and a young women, race on horseback towards a a line. The set up is the woman begins racing towards the line, while the man is a given distance ahead of her, once she passes the man he may start chasing after her, if he can catch her before she reaches the line, and steal a kiss from her, he wins, but if he cannot, and she is faster, she will get to the line, turn around, and chase after the man with a whip, if she strikes him this means that she had won this round of the game.

It is played by Kazakhs, Kyrgyz and Azeri. I’m surprised it isn’t played by Uzbeks or Turkmen considering the fact that they’re neighbours, I might be wrong though.
