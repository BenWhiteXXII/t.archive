Heritage apples, or really any type of produce noted as "heritage", are essentially breeds of apples that were cultivated generations ago for their specified uses in things suck as baking, drying, feed, ect.
Now as the apple farming, and really every other type of farming, was industrialized a lot of these breeds were lost and replaced with a "one size fits all" that was cheap enough to be justified. 

Today people, especially from rural areas,  are working on rediscovering these lost Heritage fruits and vegetables so they can once again be a part of the demographics and cultures that created them.
