Joni Mitchell and Graham Nash during their two year relationship from 1968 to 1970. 

Initially Nash wanted them to get married,  but Joni refused because she had had  issues during her previous marriage that chipped away at her trust and so wasn't ready,  they eventually split up. 

Most of the love songs they wrote during this period (and a little while after) were dedicated to eachother as well. Including my personal favorite 'Our House's off of 'Deja Vu'. The original demos of that album contains an early version of Nash and Mitchell singing it together, highly recommend it. It's very sweet.
