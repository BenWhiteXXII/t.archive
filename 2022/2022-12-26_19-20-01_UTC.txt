Sylvette David, Picasso’s muse during the 1950s was embodied in more than 40 paintings, drawings and sculptures.

In 1954, she lived in Vallauris with her mother and her fiancé, the English sculptor and designer Toby Jellinek. “We met Picasso at an exhibition and he bought one of Toby's chairs, which we delivered to his studio the next day. When we arrived he showed me my portrait painted with charcoal and asked me to pose”, recalls Sylvette. 

Picasso had become obsessed with her beauty. With Sylvette’s cooperation, Picasso drew around 40 images of her, a number of which starred in his Paris exhibition that year. It’s almost as if he was possessed. He couldn’t stop drawing and painting the portrait of his new subject. He needed to eternalize the beauty he saw in front of him. 

After such publication on May 5, 1954, Sylvette woke up famous; people on the streets of Vallauris began asking her for autographs.

Brigitte Bardot adopted the same hairstyle, presumably after seeing the coverage of Sylvette in Paris Match.
