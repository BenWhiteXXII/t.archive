Scans from various #deathtotheworld zines. 
Death to the World was an Orthodox Christian Punk zine that was produced in the 90s out of the St. Herman of Alaska Monastery in Platina, California. It was started by monks John and Damascene, as a way to evangelise to the youth in the punk scene- which John had just left. (John, also known by his worldly name- Justin Marler- was a founding member of the metal band Sleep). John saw the similar natures between the life of a street punk and a devoted monastic, but that one was plagued by youthful nihilism and self hatred. 
The 'zine was first advertised in 'Maximum Rock n' Roll' in '94 with much success. In the future the zines we're sold and distributed at punk shows and churches alike, with the zine itself holding stories of Orthodox Saints and the musings of former street urchins to equal degree.
12 issues were published before the monks stopped, with as many as 50,000 issues in circulation at the time. Although later it was picked up by another monastery to continue it's tradition.
