The Leshy is a tree spirit in Slavic mythology, who protects the forest and the wildlife that inhabits it, especially wolves and bears. He’s not often seen, but can be heard whistling and laughing from deep within the woods. He doesn’t care much for humans and usually isn’t hostile towards them unless they provoke him or cause harm to the forest and wildlife. The Leshy is however known to steal babies that have not been baptised, as well as kidnap children who’ve ventured into the woods to forage for food. 

The Leshy can take on many forms of appearance, using its surroundings to do so. He has blue blood which causes his skin to take on a blue hue, and long mossy green hair. He also wears his shoes on the wrong feet and doesn’t cast any shadow. The deeper into the woods he is, the bigger he gets. The closer to the outer edge of the woods he is, the smaller he becomes. 

He’s known as a trickster who likes to lead humans astray and get them lost deep in the woods. He uses many different tricks, and has the ability to mimic the voice and words of other humans that have passed through. It is said that the best way to get out of an encounter with an angry Leshy is to make them laugh, usually by taking your clothes off and putting them on again backwards, switching shoes and then sitting under a tree. It may sound strange but it could save your life. You could also just use the sign of a cross.

The Leshy is known to be a family man, living with his cursed human wife Leschachikha and their children, as well as children they found lost in the woods.
