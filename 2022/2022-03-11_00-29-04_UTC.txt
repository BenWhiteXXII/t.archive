An American ‘soldier of fortune’ on sentry duty stands silhouetted against the Rhodesian sunset in 1977. Although the United States formally leveled sanctions against the struggling nation, many citizens privately chose to join the Rhodesian army in the fight against communist encroachment. These men, often veterans of other wars such as Vietnam, were usually recruited through magazine advertisements and posters distributed in Europe and America. Although often incorrectly labeled mercenaries, these foreign nationals were paid the same as native Rhodesian troopers and had a three-year minimum term of enlistment regardless of origin. Unfortunately, they also shared the same fate when hostilities came to a close in 1980—the ultimatum of submitting to a brutal regime or leaving the country for which they spilled so much blood.
