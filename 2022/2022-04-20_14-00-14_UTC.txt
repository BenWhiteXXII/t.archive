Marvin "Popcorn" Sutton was an American Appalachian moonshiner and bootlegger. Born October 5, 1946, in Maggie Valley, North Carolina.
Sutton was known to claim that moonshining as a valid part of his heritage and cultural identity as a Scots-Irish American descended from a long line of bootleggers. 
He rose to notoriety in the early 2000s after appearing in feature films 'Mountain Talk' (2002) and 'This is the Last Dam Run of Likker I'll Ever Make' (also 2002). 
After firefighters investigated a fire on his property they discovered nearly 700 gallons of illegal whiskey, for which he was convicted for. In 2008, less than a year later, he sold home-brew to an undercover ATF agent and admitted in confidence that he had over 900 gallons in various hideaways ready to sell. His property soon was raided by the ATF, a raid which was led by Jim Cavanaugh, who was part of the Waco Massacre. 
A year later, on March 18th, 2009, Popcorn took his own life by carbon monoxide poisoning in a green Ford Fairmont which he had bought previously with three jugs of moonshine. His final act of defiance towards the United States Government. 
He was buried on his property in Parrotsville, with a special footstone that he made himself which read:
"POPCORN SAID FUCK YOU".
