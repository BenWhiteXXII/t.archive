The Animal Liberation Front (ALF) is an active decetralized social and political resistance/movement based around ideological and moral defiance again animal cruelty and exploitation of animals. It was founded in 1976 in the UK, and is present in over forty different countries today. 
The ALF reaches their goals via direct action, members are known for performing raids on labs known for animal testing, planting explosives or committing arson on buildings of companies that have affiliation in animal exploitation. Because of this the ALF is often considered a terrorist group by it's opposers, and of course by the local Government as well. 
 Over the years the ALF has committed possibly billions of dollars in damages, and universities and labs  that have been raided due to their 'unethical animal testing' have claimed often than years of research had been lost due to the ALF.
