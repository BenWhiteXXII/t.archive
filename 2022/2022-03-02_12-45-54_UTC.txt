The Seneca White Deer Herd.

“ The story of this herd began in 1941, when the now defunct Army Depot was constructed, and along with it a fence that ran its perimeter. Over five-hundred concrete “igloos” were erected as storehouses for munitions.  The development of this arms storage facility helped to ensure the supply of weapons for our troops during World War II.  It wasn’t until after the war had ended that, in 1949, the first white deer was observed on the base. At that time, Base Commander Colonel Frank Kemble Jr. issued an order that protected the white deer from harvest. As the population grew, and the acreage of the enclosure did not, it became necessary to hunt deer on the base to prevent their starvation – but protection for white deer remained. Over time, the proportion of white deer in the herd increased. “

The white traits present in deer in Seneca is the outcome of leucism, not albinism.
