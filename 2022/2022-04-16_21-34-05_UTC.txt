Tree Spiking is a common (and illegal) act of monkeywrenching (also known as ecological sabotage) performed to protect a tree and its surrounding forest from logging. 

A metal nail, rod, or similar object of a different material is inserted into the living wood of a tree destined for the lumber mill either at the base of the tree or well about eye level.
 The first method, with the intent of slowing down the process of cutting the tree down and/or destroying chainsaws. If enough time is set back by the spiking of enough trees in a given area a lumber company may evacuate. Although, there is a chance that loggers may be injured by the kickback of their machinery when coming across spikes, so this method is discouraged. 

The second approach of tree spiking involves placing spikes into trees as high up into the trunk as possible so that the blades at a sawmill will be destroyed instead, this also forgoes the possibility of putting a logger’s life in danger and so is preferable. The same outcome is looked for, damage to the property of a large logging company (there is no reason to spike trees being cut down by smaller or regional logging companies as they tend to be more ethical with their practices and don’t do as much damage). When an area is found to cause more trouble than it is worth and the profits are slim enough the lumber company will be forced to leave. 

Areas are often spiked prior to being sold to lumber companies, and alerts are sometimes mailed to authorities to warn them, ideally, this may lead to a sale of forest land being dropped, preserving the forest even further than stopping a project halfway. 

ECODEFENSE gives the following advice-

-never work alone or at night

-know the routines of the forest service in your area

-know the regional methods being used for marking trees so you spike the right ones. 

-pull up any survey stakes you come across
