On Easter Sunday, 1960, David Latimer decided to lower single spiderwort seed into a jar of moist manure, seal it, place it in a sunny corner, and see what happened. Since then it has only been watered once (1972) and has made itself completely self sustaining, feeding off of carbon dioxide released by decaying plant matter, and photosynthesis.
