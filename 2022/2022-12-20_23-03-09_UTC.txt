Butterflies often feed from decaying animals, rotten fruits, blood, animal feces and urine. Flowers alone do not provide enough sodium for butterflies, so they are attracted to salty things. If a butterfly has ever landed on you, it is not because it likes you or because you look particularly like a flower; actually, it is because the butterfly was attracted by the smell of salt in your sweat and blood and it wanted to eat you, but its proboscis was so tiny that you didnâ€™t feel it sucking at you.
