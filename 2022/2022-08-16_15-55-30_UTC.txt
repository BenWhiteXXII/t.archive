"In finlandâ€™s riisitunturi national park, siberian spruce trees become covered with tykky, a hard rime formed as supercooled water droplets in fog freeze to the windward side of the tree branches. some trees can collect as much as three to four tonnes of this white ice, which is less dense than the familiar clear ice."
