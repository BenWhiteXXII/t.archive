Japan’s “Killing Stone” has an interesting story behind it. It's located in Tochigi prefecture, near Tokyo and is said to kill anyone who comes into contact with it because it releases poison gas. 

According to legend, the stone was used to seal the spirit of a Nine-Tailed Fox demon Tamamo-no-Mae. Tamamo-no-Mae was a beautiful woman who was part of a plot to overthrow and kill Emperor Toba, who reigned from 1107-1123.

At some point in the first week of March this year, people noticed that the stone had split in half into roughly two equal parts.
