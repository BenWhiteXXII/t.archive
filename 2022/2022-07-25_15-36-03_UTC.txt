“That mountain is part of the sacred Black Hills. Within the Black Hills are some of the holiest sites of both the Lakota and Cheyenne. To have the mountain defaced with the likenesses of Washington, Lincoln, Jefferson, and Roosevelt has been like rubbing salt in our wounds. For us, the giant faces were the images of our conquerors, planted in the very heart of Indian country to mock us.” - Dennis Banks, Ojibwe
