Hello! I was originally intending to leave this account without saying a word to you all, but I think it is best l atleast give y'all permission to repost my stuff without need for credit. 
I will not be active anywhere besides discord (maybe) and @fintan.mathewes

It's been a good three years broskis. Glad I could entertain you all. 
God bless, Godspeed, and read Desert Solitaire by Edward Abbey please.
