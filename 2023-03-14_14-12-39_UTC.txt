Lorena Gallo (then Lorena Bobbitt), on trial for cutting off her husband's penis and throwing it out a car window after her husband sexually assaulted her that night. 

Her then husband, John Bobbitt, despite recounting several alternative stories about how the night happened, and both the prosecution and defense agreeing that John was sexually abusive, he was acquitted. Lorena was found not guilty, by reason of temporary insanity and spent a month in an asylum. 

John had his penis reattached and soon after appeared in two pornographic films based on the story of him abusing and raping his wife, and her cutting his dick off.
