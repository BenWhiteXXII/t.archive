Biquette The Goat attends a Wormrot show at La Ferme du Mauriac; Villeneuve d'Aveyron, France. September 29, 2011.

Biquette the Grindcore
Punk Goat was 5 years old when she was saved by a
farm from being sent to a slaughterhouse because she stopped producing milk. The farm
was known for hosting grindcore punk shows and
Biquette was a big fan, immediately joining in and
hanging with the crowd. Her favorite band was
Wormrot, a Singaporean grindcore band and any time
they would start playing she would go to the front of
the crowd and watch their entire set.
Biquette also had a love for tobacco and alcohol.
In the words of her rescuers, "She escaped death, lived punk."
