Audrey Hepburn with her pet deer, Pippin, in 1958. Â When she was making the film "Green Mansions", the animal trainer recommended Audrey take home the baby doe so it would learn to follow her on set during the movie (and as needed for her role). 

She fell in love with the fawn and took it everywhere.
