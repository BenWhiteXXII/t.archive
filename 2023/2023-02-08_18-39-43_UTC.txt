Contrary to what a lot of people think when they see this image, The fawn is not cuddling up to the plastic deer believing that it's its mother, chances are the mother deer left the fawn in the surrounding area to wait throughout the day while the mother went out and ate. 
Fawns are used to being alone during the day while they wait for their mothers to return, because this fawn looks fairly healthy it can be assumed nothing is wrong.
