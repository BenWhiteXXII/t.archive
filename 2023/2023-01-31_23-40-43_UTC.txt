The final photographs of Roddy Scott- "Khamzat Gelayev's Borz unit crossing the Pankisi Gorge."

In September of 2002, Roddy, a native Britain and amateur photographer and fierce conflict journalist, accompanied a group of Chechen rebels that were traveling from Georgia’s Pankisi Gorge into Chechnya and then over to Ingushetia to battle the Russians. On September 26, 2002, in Galashki, Ingushetia, near the border with Chechnya, the group was ambushed by Russian forces and after a tremendous firefight were wiped out.

Roddy survived this battle and attempted to surrender to the Russians – holding his hands up and waving an improvised white flag – but the response of the Russians was to shoot him in the face. Following his death, the Russian propaganda machine fired up and Roddy was defamed by Russian officials and declared to be a “terrorist.” Taking matters even further, the Russian government attempted to extort Roddy’s family by refusing to issue a death certificate or to return his body unless a significant sum of money was paid. Roddy’s family defeated this attempted extortion by simply demanding that, in true British tradition, Roddy be buried where he fell.
