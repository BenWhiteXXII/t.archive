Italian composer Piero Piccioni (December 6, 1921 â€“ July 23, 2004)
Mostly known for his soundtrack compositions, Piccioni actually has a far more interesting backstory than you'd think. 
He made his radio debut in 1938 at the age of 17 with a jazz band, but would not return until 1945 when his band was the first jazz group to grace Italian airwaves after the fall of fascism. 
In the 1950s he worked as a lawyer securing music rights for films but then decided that his job would be a lot easier if he just composed film music himself, which he turned into a full-time job, composing music for over 300 films before he died in 2004. 
A notorious hard case with his mastertapes he allegedly went as far as to bury the original recordings of his soundtracks in his backyard to keep them safe. As was confirmed with his soundtrack for the 1970 film 'Camille 2000' when it was reissued in the 90s.
