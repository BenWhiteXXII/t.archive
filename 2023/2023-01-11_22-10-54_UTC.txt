Slovenian philosopher Slavoj Zizek (56) and his third (?) wife, Argentinian model, Lacanian Scholar, and psychoanalyst Analia Hounie (26) at their wedding in 2005.

In a 2012 interview with Salon Zizek talks about the wedding:

{Interviewer}: I’ve seen those photos. For someone who describes love as violent and unnecessary, you seem to have pulled off quite the affair. Your wife [Argentinian model Analia Hounie] wore a long white dress and held a bouquet. How traditional! 

{Zizek}: Yes, but did you notice something? If you look at the photos, you can see that I am not happy. Even my eyes are closed. It’s a psychotic escape. This is not happening. I’m not really here.

I planted some jokes in my wedding. Like, the organizers asked me to select music. So when I approached wife at the ceremony, they played the second movement from Shostakovich’s 10th Symphony, which is usually known as the “portrait of Stalin.” And then when we embraced, the music that they played was Schubert’s “Death and the Maiden.” I enjoyed this in a childish way! But marriage was all a nightmare and so on and so on.

{Interviewer}:So you did it for your wife, this big wedding? 

{Zizek}: Yes, she was dreaming about it.
