Comics by Elizabeth Eaton "Connie" Converse, probably during her college years. 
Connie is mostly known for making some of the earliest known recordings of the singer-songwriter subgenre and disappearing in the early 70s after a bout of depression, leaving a few notes for her family never to be heard from again.

The 'Educating Henry' comics display her childhood relationship with her brother, Philip, who to this day champions the search for Connie and the spreading of her music.
