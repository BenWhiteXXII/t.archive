In 1959 Vladimir Demikhov, a Soviet scientist and organ transplant pioneer, attached the upper body of a small dog to the neck of a large dog. The small dog was a nine year old female named Shavka and the large male dog who was a stray picked up in the streets by a dog catcher was named Brodyaga.

By the time the news of the operation hit America in 1959, the surgeon - Vladimir Demikhov, 43 at the time - had already been performing transplants on dogs for five years.

This post has photos from two two-headed dog experiments, one being from 1955 as well.
