A polar bear cub hugs its dead mother, 1947. 

This was taken by the famous photographer Lennart Nilsson in Svalbard 1947 and was one of his first pictures to be published in Life Magazine. "The mother bear tried to escape when they saw us but the younger bear wanted to see us, the mother was shot and the little bear tied with a rope around his neck and brought up onboard with his mother"

"Broken-hearted cub, realizing his mother is dead, embraces her.  Little bear remained in this position all day and night, whimpering and refusing proffered food."- caption for the photo as appeared in the article.
