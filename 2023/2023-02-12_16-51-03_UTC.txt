Tombstones of members of the Russian Mafia.

Following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Russian mafia bosses with close government connections grew immensely rich. In the chaotic post-Soviet years, the ones that enjoyed tremendous wealth started killing to preserve their riches and to guard their turf. The graveyards in Russiaâ€™s most violent gangster zones have special areas reserved for fallen mobsters. Their final resting place is marked with showy marble tombstones, each one intricately engraved to depict the deceased in a variety of poses looking tough, or relaxed, and of course with a fair share of Orthodox Christian iconography and symbolism.
