Mike Parr- Blood Box, 1998. 

“A man enters the space, he’s dressed as a bride, white dress, full regalia. S/he sits on a chair, a medico comes and extracts blood from a vein, it siphons into a plastic medical-like receptacle. The bride is sleep deprived, s/he hasn’t slept for 24 hours, s/he looks tired. S/he enters a glass chamber via a ladder, up and over the top and down the other side, the ladder is extracted, s/he is alone, contained. The collected blood is handed to the bride who squirts it around the glass walls of her cell, creating a red liquid veil that pools in the corners of the enclosure. She lays down, at last to sleep. Visitors come and go, they look into the glass cube, through a screen of blood they see the man-bride sleeping.”
