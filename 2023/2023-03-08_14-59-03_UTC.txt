Clube Da Esquina, a musicians and poets collective from the Brazilian State, Minas Gerais. Included artists such as, Lo Borges, Milton Nascimento, Márcio Borges, Flávio Venturini, Wagner Tiso, Beto Guedes, Toninho Horta, Fernando Brant, and the bands 14 Bis, and Som Imagionario.

The collective is mostly known for the 1972 album, 'Clube Da Esquina', which was released 51 years ago this month. The album, of course being a collected project, is credited between mostly Lo Borges, and Milton Nascimento, who became friends because they used to live in the same apartment building. Lo was around 16 when the project began. But he had been writing songs long before. The album wasn't recorded in Minas Gerais, but a beach house to aid with the atmosphere. Regardless, the album was a sleeper success, disliked by the state-owned critics, but loved by the populace for its honesty, poetry, and atmosphere, and today is considered the greatest Brazilian album of all time.
