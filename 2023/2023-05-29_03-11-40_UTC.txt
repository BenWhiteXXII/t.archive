Mariko Mori, "Beginning of the End" (1995 - 2000)

“Starting in 1995, I went to 13 cities around the world with my Body Capsule for the ‘Beginning of the End’ series, including Angkor Wat, Teotihuacan, Tokyo, and Manhattan. In the final work, completed in 2000, all the cities are connected — east and west, as well as past, present, and future.”
