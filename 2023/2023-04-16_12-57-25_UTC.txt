Christos Anesti!
Holy Fire from the Church Of the Holy Sepulchre, in Jerusalem, a tradition that at least goes as far back as the 4th century.

According to tradition a pillar of blue flame rises from the marble slab that covers the stone bed where Jesus was said to have been laid after being taken down from the cross, from this the priest ignites his candles and walks outside of the tomb to the parishioners and pilgrims and lights their candles.
Both clergy and pilgrims testify that the fire is non-harming and often stick extremities or their face into the fire to be enveloped by it (pictured). 
Afterwards the fire is flown across the world to Churches and Orthodox Households. 

The authenticity of this miracle has long been attacked by Catholic and Muslim authorities for hundreds of years, as well as clergy from the Greek Orthodox Church claiming that sometimes 'non-miraculous' methods of ignition can be used, but I'm having trouble finding actual names or genuine testimonies of this.
