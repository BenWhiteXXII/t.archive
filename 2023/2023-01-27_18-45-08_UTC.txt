Vladimir Oidupaa and his wife singing "My Sons and Daughters"

Oidupaa(September 6th 1949- December 25th 2013) was a Tuvan musician, who performed Kargyraa and played bayan. He was considered one of the leading figures in the contemporary Tuvan music during his lifetime. 

Vladimir Oidupaa learn to the accordion during his 33-year stay in prison work camps for three counts of murder and corruption of a minor, crimes that he maintained his innocence for his entire life. While in Russian work camps he also converted to Orthodox Christianity.

In 1999 he released "Divine Music From a Jail", his debut album of Tuvian music.

In 2007, Oidupaa appeared at the Channel One Russia in Moscow in one of the contest programs, but was booed from the podium before he could finish his performance, and Tatyana Tolstaya, one of the jury members, called his style "discordant" and "disharmonious".Oidupaa himself claimed later that he irritated her on purpose, to avoid the Channel broadcasting his records for free for two years in case he would win.
