"The Lovers Of Valdaro" a pair of human skeletons (A woman's and a man's both around 20 years of age), dated as approximately 6,000 years old. They were discovered by archaeologists at a Neolithic tomb in Italy, in 2007. The two individuals were buried face to face with their arms around each other, in a position reminiscent of a "lovers' embrace".
Although instances of flint tools and weapons can be found around their bodies the actual causes of death are unknown and it's been decided that their embrace will not be disturbed, nor will they be separated, for the sake of answering this question.
