Excerpts from Marilyn Monroe's diaries.
1:."My body is my body, every part of it."

2: "having a sense of myself"

3: "Alone!!!! I am alone, I am always alone, no matter what."

4: "Oh damn I wish that I were dead — absolutely nonexistent — gone away from here — from everywhere but how would I do it. There is always bridges — the Brooklyn bridge — no not the Brooklyn Bridge because But I love that bridge (everything is beautiful from there and the air is so clean) walking it seems peaceful there even with all those cars going crazy underneath. So it would have to be some other bridge an ugly one and with no view — except I particularly like in particular all bridges — there’s some-thing about them and besides these I’ve never seen an ugly bridge."

5:"depression - it starts to depress me when I feel that I have exposed my truest feelings to people. I am afraid that they see through me - my faults and the fact that I am really a phoney who needs and wants admiration and love (I do not want to be like this - to depend on this need)."
