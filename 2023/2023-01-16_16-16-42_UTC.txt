Sweetheart Grips - especially popular during WWII- soldiers were known to take photos of their “sweetheart”, and put them under clear plexiglass grips on their service pistols.
 This started with servicemen salvaging plexiglass from downed vehicles and using it to replace the grips for their Colt M1911 pistols. 
Essentially all you had to do was sneak photos under the plexiglass and you had a personalized weapon.
