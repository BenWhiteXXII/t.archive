Jenny Holzer, Living (1980-1982)
"Living" was a series of installations of conspicuous bronze plaques that were anonymously installed in public spaces such as telephone boxes, buildings, and alleyways.
These plaques were intended to be viewed as reflections on human condition and interactions and were left without credit or makers mark, giving them an aura of ambiguity, but to imitate at least some sort of voice of authority.
