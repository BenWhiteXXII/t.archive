I bruised my hands so badly yesterday because I was biking on one of the trails near my house and while changing gears the back wheel locked up and threw me OVER the handles and I broke the fall with my palms. I am surprised I didn't break anything by doing that. 
I also wasn't wearing a helmet and I will continue to not wear a helmet.
