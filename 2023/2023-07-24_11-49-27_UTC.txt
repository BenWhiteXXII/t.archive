Death to the World was an Orthodox Christian Punk zine that was produced in the mid-90s out of the St. Herman of Alaska Monastery in Platina, California, which had been founded by Father Seraphim Rose in 1968. It was started by monks John and Damascene, as a way to evangelise to the youth in the punk scene- which John had just left. (John, also known by his worldly name- Justin Marler- was a founding member of the metal band Sleep). John saw the similar natures between the life of a street punk and a devoted monastic, but that one was plagued by youthful nihilism and self hatred and abuse. He sought to connect with people who had been in a similar situation he had been, claiming that before he had left Sleep life in California weighed heavily on him, in an interview with 'My Statesman' he said:
	“I was cutting myself with razor blades and having some pretty significant depression issues and it was leading into, I think, mental illness really. I would walk the streets of Oakland and I would be slobbering on myself and screaming. I was just losing my mind.
[On leaving Sleep] “It was a matter of life or death, “I was intent on trying to kill myself, or find some purpose.”

The 'zine was first advertised in 'Maximum Rock n' Roll' in '94 with much success. The zines we're sold and distributed at punk shows and churches alike, with the magazine itself holding stories of Orthodox Saints and the musings of former street urchins to equal degree.
12 issues were published before the monks stopped, with as many as 50,000 issues in circulation at the time. Although later it was picked up by another monastery to continue its tradition today.
