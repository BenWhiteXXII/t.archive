In 1997, while being photographed for Spin, Fiona Apple was caught muttering "there is no hope for women," in a trance like state for nearly the entire shoot. 

The photographer, Terry Richardson, would tell her, "Be sexy, seduce me," 
It should be noted that since 2001 Terry has been routinely accused of sexual misconduct against his models and no longer works in photography.

In 2017 Fiona added to the legend by saying that she does believe there is hope for women, "because women are the hope," and that she was only reacting to how uncomfortable the photographer made her.
