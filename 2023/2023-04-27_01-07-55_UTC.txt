Weegee, Naked City, 1945. 

Weegee was the pseudonym for photojournalist Arthur Fellig. The cops dubbed him 'Ouji' (Weegee) because he had some sort of sixth sense that led him to crime scenes and disasters long before the cops. 

He named this book 'Naked City' as he intended to lay New York bare. The name was also borrowed by Avent Garde jazz musician John Zorn for a project/band that used the first photo in this slideshow for one of their album covers. 

While original copies of this book can go between $100 and $2,000 you can catch a '70s or '80s reprint for less than $30 usually.
Regardless you can see the entire thing online for free.
