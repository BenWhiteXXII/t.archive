Tree houses built by the Korowai people in Papua, Indonesian New Guinea, primarily for the benefit of film crews as true Korowai homes are only 5 to 10 meters above the ground and are not built on stilts but fastened to crowns of tall trees. Take note that the first one is completely abandoned. 

The purpose for having a treehouse in an environment like this is because it keeps people out of reach from most animals, mosquitoes and evil spirits.
