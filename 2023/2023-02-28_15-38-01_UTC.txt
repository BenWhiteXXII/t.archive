Arthur Bispo de Rosário. 1909-1989. Brazil.

 One of the triggers for the beginning of Bispo do Rosário's work was the voices of those who said: “it's time for you to rebuild the world”. A world, according to reports, utopian, without misery, hunger and disease.
 A sufferer of schizophrenia which greatly influenced his art style.
