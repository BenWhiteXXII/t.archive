Today, January 4th, is the birthday of David Berman. American poet, songwriter, singer for bands such as the Silver Jews and Purple mountains.  In college, David met two members of pavement with whom recorded the first Silver Jews EP, in 1989, between then and the dissolve of the band he wrote and helped release six albums.
In 2009, when he ended the Silver Jews he wrote an open letter in which he revealed, with shame, that his father was Richard Berman, a lobbyist who David said "led campaigns against animal rights, trade unions, and even opposed anti-drunk driving groups." 
After a long hiatus Purple Mountains was formed and was the last we would we hear from Berman's artistry, as it was his final release before his death. 
Berman faced a lifelong battle with drug addiction and what he called "treatment resistant depression" which came to an end in August according to New York city's medical examiner Bernan died by suicide in a park slope apartment.
Where Berman saw pain in others he resonated in it with himself and left behind one of American rock history's richest, dirtiest, funniest, gentlest, and most humane bodies of work, songs that reach out to the lonely and suffering.

Rest in Peace

"One has lived life carelessly
If he or she is failed to see
That the truth is not alive or dead
The truth is struggling to be said"
