"Welcome To Fear City" a 1975 pamphlet created by union members of NYC law enforcement to protest Mayor Abe Beame who publicly considered laying off as many as 10,000 people who worked for the city police or fire departments. Essentially arguing that the police could barely do their job as is, and that these layoffs would make it worse. 
Over 1,000,000 copies were printed.
