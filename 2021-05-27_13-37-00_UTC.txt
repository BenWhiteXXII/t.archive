Slavoj Žižek as a representative of the New Liberal Party on the presidential debate of Slovenia — 1990

The debate was part of the first post-WW2 multiparty elections for the presidency of the Slovenian country which was, back then, part of Yugoslavia.

Interestingly, the future was discussed in the debate, and communism was out of question.
