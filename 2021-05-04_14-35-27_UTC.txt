Nothing is following you. 

It's an oddly warm night, the moon is full, and the buzz in your veins hums to the tune of a six-pack. Your phone is at 20%, and you still have so long to go. The crickets are silent. There isn't even the rumble of a distant car, only the rustling of the grass and the high-pitched whirr of the moonlight.

You walk a little faster, but the skip in your step falters.

Nothing is following you, and you'd give anything to make it stop.

1995 was a good year
