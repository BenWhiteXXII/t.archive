'Sasuke', 1977, 深瀬 昌久 / Fukase Masahisa.

When his muse and wife Yoko Wanibe left him in 1976, Masahisa Fukase was given a kitten. Ironically, the kitten, Sasuke, ran away after ten days. After searching around the neighbourhood, a woman called him saying she found a cat. It turned out not to be Sasuke, but Fukase adopted him anyways, photographing him everywhere he went. Fukase said that he constantly imagined changing into a cat, and thought of photographing the cat’s growth from his time as a kitten as his living partner.
