Louis Armstrong on a CIA funded trip in Egypt, 1960. 

During the Cold war the United States government funded jazz musicians, black ones, specifically, as a way to flex cultural superiority over the Soviet Union. The CIA would help pay touring fees for musicians so long as they went to parts of the world that they felt the need to have good press for the United States. Usually these were areas that were close to the Soviet Union, in the Soviet Union, or countries that could be swayed either way in terms of trade and cultural support. They also printed literature for these artists that explicitly told them to downplay the significance of racial issues in the United States, something that as far as I know was laughed off and not kept seriously.
