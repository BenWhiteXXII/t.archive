The Loretto Chapel “Miraculous Stair” in New Mexico. It was mysteriously built without the use of nails or glue and lacks a central pole or external supports. It remains a marvel to woodworkers for seemingly defying physics, while today certainly replicateable, it stands a monolithic of design considering its time period. After the death of the chapel’s architect in 1879, the building was nearly finished but the choir loft was left inaccessible. Multiple local craftsmen were consulted but turned down the job because they were unable to find a workable solution due to the confined quarters. The nuns of the chapel prayed for 9 consecutive days, channeling Saint Joseph, the earthly father of Jesus & Patron Saint of Carpenters. On the 9th day, a stranger entered the chapel from the desert and constructed the elaborate staircase alone using only simple tools. Upon its completion, he left without collecting payment or telling the nuns his name. When the nuns reached out to local lumber suppliers in attempt to find the man to pay & thank him, none of them had seen him. 
The stair winds approximately 760 degrees total, more than two full turns, and is made of Spruce; it ascends a total of 22 ft. from floor to floors.

The joinery used on the treads, risers, stringers, and even the stair backing and subsequent plaster, all work together to create a "torsion box" effect, giving the stair some rigidity; however, its main source of support is from the tight radius of the inside "boxed stringer" which has a "stringer leg" attached below the start of the stair which gives the first 180 degrees direct support from the floor. The stair originally shook quite a bit when walked on and two iron brackets were added to stabilize the stair between the wall and a support column.
