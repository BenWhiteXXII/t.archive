Zhang Da Zhong's Red Guard series depicts female members of the Red Guards (student-led paramilitary organizations formed as part of Mao Zedong's Chinese Cultural Revolution of 1965-1968). During said movement, gender equality was particularly emphasized: women were to help develop the nation alongside men.  From Da Zhong's website: "They were encouraged not to be feminine but to be part of the homogeneous mass and be androgynous workers, to wear loose clothing and bow their heads to hide their natural curves." Da Zhong had female friends and sisters who were members, and they were likely the  inspiration for the series.

The Red Guard series was intended to "enhance the true femininity and feelings of these women in contrast with the combat environment".

Note that they appear to be carrying Type 53 Carbines, a Chinese variation of the Mosin Nagant.
