Abbot Ter-Hovhannes, of the Dadivank Monastery in ArmeniaðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡², as well as a true Armenian Patriot. Here is some information I could find about him from extremely biased Azeri resources.

-In 1988 he named his second son Artsakh in support of reunification. 
-graduated from seminary in February, 1992 and became part of the Artsakh diocese.
-Couldn't bear to pray over soldiers and send them away to fight while he stayed behind so he began fighting in the conflict as well. Praying and holding services during the day, then fighting at night, leaving his machine gun at the steps of his church when he returned to ask for forgiveness. 
-In April of '92 Priest Hovhannes along with Monte Melkyon, Norayr Danielyan and other commanders were the first to enter Dadivank, when they broke into the Kalbajar region and managed to expell as many as 44,000 Azeri militants and invaders within 10 hours.
-Became Abbot of Dadivank and remains to this day, although he considered leaving when the area was taken by Azeri control again, he stayed after Russian peacekeepers agreed to help protect it from vandalism.
