On this day, seven years ago, we lost Charlie Megira to suicide. 
For those who were not familiar with his work, Charlie Megira/ Gabriel Abudraham, was an Israeli-born experimental musician, mostly influenced by rockabilly and surf rock, who bubbled around in the underground, releasing around six different albums under his own persona, band, or side projects. 
Most of the photos on this post are either from him performing live with his band 'The Modern Dance Club' or photo shoots. Rest in peace. 

Partial credit to @_obscuredbyclouds since their post reminded me to make my own.
