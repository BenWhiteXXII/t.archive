30 years ago yesterday on August 22nd, 1992, Ruby Ridge, Idaho. An 11 day siege took place that began on the 21st, it was initiated in hopes to apprehend and arrest Randy Weaver under a bench warrant after his failure to appear on firearms charges. 

On the 21st six U.S. Marshals encountered Harris and Weaver's 14-year-old son, Sammy, in woods near the family cabin, a shootout quickly took place killing Deputy U.S. Marshal William Francis Degan, Sammy Weaver, and the Weavers' dog, Striker. In the subsequent siege of the Weaver residence on the 22nd, led by the FBI, Weaver's wife Vicki was killed by FBI sniper fire while holding her baby. All casualties occurred in the first two days of the operation. This all started because an ATF agent entrapped Randy Weaver by buying two sawed off shotguns that were allegedly shorter in length than allowed by federal law. And then the wrong court date was sent to Mr. Weavers and when he didn't show up to the court on the date he didn't receive, the feds decided to take down the weaver family by any means necessary. 

Also they kept asking for his wife to surrender while she lay dead in the house. Some speculate they knew she was dead and were taunting him. They even asked for her to "come outside and make pancakes for the kids." 

Never forget.
