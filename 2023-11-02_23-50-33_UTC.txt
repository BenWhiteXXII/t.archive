"Andy Warhol and Joan Didion," a total cash grab from Interview magazine, in 2020 they "interviewed" Joan Didion, then 85 years old, by using commonly asked questions used by Warhol during his tenure as an interviewer then marketed it like Warhol (who died in 1987) had asked her these questions himself. I honestly don't even know if they told her what the plan was but it's hilarious.
