One time, i was on my break at work, and i went across the street to go get a burger from mcdonalds, but after i made my order it turned out i didnt have enough money. 
So as im telling the cashier to take some things out the meanest looking old geezer in the world is right behind me and grunts:
"Ill pay for it"
I thanked him and began my meal , and when i was done i stood up and was about to thank him again, but he stopped me and said: "dont thank me, what i want you to do is accept jesus christ into your heart"
I just pulled my cross out from my shirt and showed it to him. 
And he smiled and let me go.

And then everybody clapped.
