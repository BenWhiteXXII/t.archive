Nature overruns an abandoned US Naval Facility. 

The now abandoned (closed in 1997) Adak Naval Air Facility was a United States Navy airport located on Adak Island in Alaska. 

Located on the furthest reaches of the Aleutian Islands, Adak is actually the westernmost municipality in the U.S. 

Due to harsh winds, frequent cloud cover, and cold temperatures the islandâ€™s vegetation is mostly tundra including grasses, mosses and  low-lying flowering plants.
