Elizabeth Eaton Converse (born August 3, 1924, disappeared 1974), known professionally as 'Connie Converse', was an female American singer-songwriter and musician, active in New York City in the 1950s. Her work is among the earliest-known recordings of the singer-songwriter genre.

Converse left her family home in 1974 in search of a new life and was not heard from again. Her music was largely unknown until it was featured on a 2004 radio show and a compilation album of her work, How Sad, How Lovely, was released in March 2009 by her brother, Phillip.

Converse was born in Laconia, New Hampshire in 1924. She was raised in Concord, New Hampshire as the middle child in a strict Baptist family; her father was a minister and her mother was "musical", according to music historian David Garland.

During the 1950s, Converse worked for the Academy Photo Offset printing house in New York's Flatiron District. She first lived in Greenwich Village, then in the Hell's Kitchen and Harlem areas. She started calling herself Connie, a nickname she had acquired in New York. She began writing songs and performing them for friends, accompanying herself on guitar. She began smoking during this time and started drinking; traits strongly contrary to her religious upbringing. Possibly as a result, her parents rejected her music career, and her father never heard her sing before his death.
