On 20 August, 1976, four men were night fishing while on a camping trip at the Allagash Waterway, during which they claimed to see a strange object floating towards them. What happened next became one of the most famous cases of alien abduction in history. They began to run and then saw a bright flash from the object and the next thing they knew, they were standing on the bank again. The group claimed to have missed a large portion of time. They noted that they had lit a fire which seemed to have burned out in a matter of moments. The men all had nightmares over the next few weeks, all of which were very similar and depicted them being  “probed and tested by four-fingered beings with almond-shaped eyes and languid limbs”. They claimed that they were abducted by aliens and their stories matched and all passed lie detector tests.
