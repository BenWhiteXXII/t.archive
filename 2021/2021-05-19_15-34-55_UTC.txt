As a child I would look at my great grandmother's paintings and simply get lost in them.
At the time I had no idea her hands had made them, as she had died before I was born so she couldn't have told me that the landscapes and scenes that adorned my childhood household were not cheap replicates of famous creations. But instead were closely hidden family secrets that told our story and explained in dark detail how our bloodline was intertwined not only with the foundation of America, but also the oldest running  pyramid scheme in world history (1354 years and counting). 
These were part of a series that had been started by the first of my family name to come to america (far before our independence, which served an issue for us, but we resolved it quickly). Entitled: "Of Wheat and Chaff." 
But now the glory days of our family have long since been forgetten by many, and we simply sit on our troves of gold and watch the world burn from a distance.
