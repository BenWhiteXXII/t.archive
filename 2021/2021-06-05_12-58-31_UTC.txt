Yesterday marked 32 years since June 4th, 1989 and the barbaric slaughter of presumably 10,000 chinese protestors by the People's Liberation Army. After months of protests advocating for free speech and democratic elections, PLA soldiers opened fire on tens of thousands of unarmed protestors with live ammunition and crushed them with Type 59 main battle tanks and Type 63 Armored Personnel Carriers. To this day the Chinese Communist Party censors any mention of these events for obvious reasons. This event, among many others is why I have a visceral reaction to any symanthies towards the CCP. They are totalitarian barbarians who suppress free thought and commit genocide to remain in absolute power. To this day the CCP shuts down freedom protests, the most famous of those being in Hong Kong. We can thank the fact that every person at these protests has an HD camera in their pocket at all times or else this massacre would be one of numerous atrocities in the past 32 years. China trying to save face is the one reason they haven't repeated an incident like this so publicly.
