This antique rosary has a hidden compartment where relics could be kept. Most often, these rosaries contained soil from the catacombs in Rome where many Catholic martyrs are buried. These were also used as mourning jewelry and are sometimes found with locks of hair or ashes.

The crucifix is ebony wood and the beads are dyed green bone.
