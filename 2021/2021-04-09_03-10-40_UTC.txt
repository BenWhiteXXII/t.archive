We often romanticize a "past" or "future" that never really existed, not outside of biased commerciality and fiction writing. Be happy with what you have, it is all you have until you let it slip away. Tell that girl how you really feel about her, clean up your damn room, lift weights if real labor scares you, and pray that God forgives you. 
Because a lot of people forgot how.
