Another one of my inspirations.

Did you know the closest romantic relationship Ted K had was with a girl at a factory he work at for a time under his brother's supervision? He had his first kiss at 36 and she proceeded to dump him not much later, he then began a slander campaign at work leaving unflattering fliers around the workspace spreading rumours about her. He was fired.
