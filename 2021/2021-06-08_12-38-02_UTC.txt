In 1985, Tacoma Washington, a number of Spanaway Junior High School students heard 14-year-old Heather Smith threaten to “get” her ex-boyfriend, Gordon Pickett, and his best friends. None of them took her threats serious, though. “We didn’t really think she’d do anything,” said one student. Smith, who was a straight-A student, was a practical joker and everybody thought she was kidding around. 

However, Smith wasn’t kidding around. Two days before thanksgiving of 1985, Smith retrieved a .22-caliber semiautomatic rifle from her home and returned to school. She waited for Pickett to leave the gym after wrestling practice. Pickett left the gym with his best friend, Chris Ricco, 15. Upon seeing Smith standing there, armed with a rifle, Ricco stood in front of Pickett, hoping Smith wouldn’t shoot. She did. First, she fired at Ricco and then fired at Pickett before fleeing. 

Smith shortly returned to the scene which was now surrounded by officers. They urged Smith to put the rifle down, telling her “it’ll be all right.” Smith responded: “No, it won’t,” before pointing the gun at herself and pulling the trigger. Pickett, who was shot once in the head, died at the scene. Ricco, who suffered three gunshot wounds, died the following day at Madigan Army Medical Center. Several hours later, Smith died at the same hospital as her victim. An investigation into the shooting revealed that Pickett had broken up with Smith, telling her that he only wanted to be friends.
