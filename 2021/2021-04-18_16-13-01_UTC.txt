"Indeed, an amusing war, for the Americans"
Part of the "Girl You Left Behind" series of  demoralizing leaflets that German fascists dropped on English-speaking troops during WWII.

This was more so directed at causing poor relations between British and American soldiers who were fighting together in Italy, where most of these were dropped. Playing on the fear that their wives would be unfaithful while they were at war.
