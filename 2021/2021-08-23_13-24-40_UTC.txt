If only video game ads were this good still 😵‍💫

- Incredible Crisis “Mr. Takahiro ad”, December 2000.
- Sonic Adventure in GamePro magazine, November 1999
- Australian Visual Software Distributors Association’s ad in Playstation Magazine, February 1999
-  Innocent Until Caught in a French magazine 
- VZones, in Games Domain Offline magazine, May 2000.
- Tekken 4 ad in Players magazine in Germany 
- Ballz Christmas ad, in GamePro magazine, January 1995
- Beyoncé in a Rhythm Paradise ad in Spain, in 2009. 

If my video game ads aren’t cursing at me and manipulating me, I don’t want it 😒
