Kitty Craft was the stage name of Pamela Valfer of Minneapolis, Minnesota, during her few years as an indie musician she released three albums: Kitty Craft(1995-- of which a rip is yet to be found), Beats and Breaks From the Flower Patch(1998), and Catskills (2000), along with three EPs: It's Stupid (1995), I Got Rulez (1997), and Hello Kitty Craft (2004).

Her music holds a rather unique sound, blending hip-hop and indie elements, along with dreamy synths and an angelic yet welcoming voice.

To quote a comment on her Last.FM page: "Kitty Craft walked, so Nujabes could jog, so lofi hip hop radio - beats to relax/study to could run."

As of last year, a new album Titled 'Lost Tapes' was released and she created an Instagram account (@kittycraft_band) 
I am hoping vinyl re-issues might happen someday.
