Come sleep on the beach
Keep within my reach
I just want to die with you here
I'm feeling so high with you here
I'm wet and I'm cold
But thank God I ain't old
Why didn't I say what I mean?
I should have split home at fifteen
There's a story that the grass is so green
What did I see? Where have I been?

Nothing is planned by the sea and the sand

The Who- Sea and Sand
