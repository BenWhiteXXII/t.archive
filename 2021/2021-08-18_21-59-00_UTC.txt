Karen Knorr - Academies, 1994 -  Within the spaces of the Royal Academy Schools in London, the Royal Academy of Art in Stockholm, and the Repin Institute in St Petersburg, Knorr reflects upon the relationship between the production of western art in the academy and the transmission and reproduction of such ideas through the museum. The series explores the foundation myths of European fine art culture and the link to national identity and patrimony.
