At a young age, in school, we are taught  a dumbed down version of history as to give us merely a general idea of the truth. As time goes on, they fill in the cracks.

Columbus wasnt the first European to discover the Americas like we told you in Middle School. That would have been Leif the Lucky, hundreds of years beforehand, its just easier to give you a general truth with some lies ad fill it up later on by shaving away the bullshit.
