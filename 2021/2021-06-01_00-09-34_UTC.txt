Tattoos of Soviet prisoners, USSR.
The tattoo system of Russian prisoners is one of the most complex in the world. With their help, prisoners in prisons and camps expressed their protest against the perceived injustice of the state, demonstrated their status in the criminal world, or simply expressed themselves. Tattoos among prisoners were so popular in Soviet times that even entire encyclopedias are dedicated to them.
