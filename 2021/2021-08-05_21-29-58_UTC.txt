“If you become rich, consider whether or not you could worthily bare poverty. If you are happy, imagine how you could worthily meet unhappiness. When people praise you, think how you might worthily bare insult.  And, all your life, think how you might worthily meet death.” – St. Nikolai Velimirovich
