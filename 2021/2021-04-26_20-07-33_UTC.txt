A snippet from Abroad in Japan's video about the effects of the Tohoku Tusnami on it's people and the area. An interview with Ichiyo Kano, the sole owner of an inn called Tsunakan who decided to keep it open and running despite losing her husband, eldest daughter and son-in-law in a boating accident which caused the boat to capsize 6 years after the tsunami hit. https://youtu.be/gR5KVIP7PKk
