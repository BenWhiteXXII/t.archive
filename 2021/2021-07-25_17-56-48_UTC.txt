Bill Haast was the director of the Miami Serpantarium Laboratories, a facility near Miami in Florida, that produces snake venom for medical and research use. As a result of handing snakes, Bill was bitten 172 times. He donated his blood to he used in treating victims of snake bites when an anti-venom was no available. Over 20 of the snake bite individuals survived and made a full recovery. Before he passed away in 2011 at the age of 100, he said: “Aging is hard. Sometimes, you feel useless. But I always felt I would live this long. It was intuitive. I always told people I’d like past 100, and I still feel I will. Is it the venom? I don’t know…”
