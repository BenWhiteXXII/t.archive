Björk and Milton Nascimento, 1998. 

In 1996 Bjork made a cover of Milton's 1967 song "Travessia" for a compilation called "Red Hot & Rio," unfortunately her cover didn't make the cut but Björk became so enamored with the song that the spiralled into the world of Brazilian MPB and Tropicália. Influenced by this she collaborated with famous composer Eumir Deodato to do the orchestration for her albums 'Post' and 'Homogenic'. 
There is a also very special 'Deodato Version' of 'Isobel' (from Post) that contains a more "Brazilian rhythm" that you can hear on YouTube and Spotify. The song 'Isobel' was also dedicated to another Brazilian musician, Elis Regina.
