The 'Carnation Revolution' April 24th, 1974.

It started when a group of military officers led by Colonel Otelo Saraiva de Carvalho secretly set up a command post at the Pontinha Barracks in Lisbon. During the early morning of April 25, the military broadcasted, through Rádio Renascença, the song "Grândola, Vila Morena" by Zeca Afonso - a work censored by the Portuguese regime for its supposed communist references. The performance of the song was the password previously agreed upon for the beginning of the military uprising and the taking of positions. Throughout the day, military troops stationed throughout the country conducted a concerted operation, taking over airports and public facilities and occupying the Portuguese government's official communication organs, such as Radiotelevisão Portuguesa (RTP) and Rádio Clube Português (RCP). In the north, Lieutenant Colonel Carlos de Azeredo led the takeover of the headquarters of the Oporto Military Region.

The Portuguese regime reacted by ordering the troops stationed in Braga to quell the uprising. The soldiers, however, had already joined the uprising and refused to obey orders. Upon realizing what was happening, the Portuguese population took to the streets to show support for the military uprising. The people began to offer red carnations to the soldiers as a sign of gratitude. The soldiers hooked the carnations on their uniforms or positioned them on the tips of their rifles, which is why the uprising received the name "Carnation Revolution". Leaving from Santarém, the soldiers from the Cavalry Practical School occupied the Terreiro do Paço and the Carmo Barracks, where the president Marcello Caetano was, who surrendered at the end of the day. The dictator left for Madeira and then went into exile in Brazil. Agents from the regime's political police even rehearsed a reaction, killing four civilian demonstrators, but soon gave up when they realized that resistance would be untenable.
