Kudzu was first introduced to North America through seed catalogs in the late 1800s, advertised as a cheap livestock feed crop, and as an ornamental vine with sweet-smelling flowers. 
Later the Soil Erosion Service and Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s gave about 85 million kudzu plants to southern landowners as a way to fight soil erosion caused by bad farming techniques. 

Throughout the 30s and 40s efforts to promote kudzu continued, this included the establishment of 'kudzu clubs' and paying farmers to plant kudzu by the acre.

By the 1950s its reputation had started to be realized to be one of a non-native nuisance. It had spread rapidly throughout the South because of the long growing season, warm climate, plentiful rainfall, and lack of disease or insect enemies. Abandonment of farmland during this time contributed to the uncontrolled spread of kudzu. In 1953, the United States Department of Agriculture removed kudzu from the list of cover plants permissible under the Agricultural Conservation Program. In 1962, the Soil Conservation Service limited its recommendation of kudzu to areas far removed from developed areas. Finally, in 1970, the USDA listed kudzu as a common weed in the South. Congress voted in 1997 to place kudzu on the Federal Noxious Weed list, where it remained for a few years. While no longer on the Federal Noxious Weed list, kudzu is currently listed as a noxious weed in 13 states

It is estimated that kudzu may cover more than 7.4  million acres in the Southeastern United States alone, although this is highly challenged. 

Despite its poor reputation to rural southerners, it still is considered a landmark of southern culture and a unique part of the mythos  With it being foraged for folk remedies and food for livestock and humans alike. Kudzu Jelly is a common sight at many farmers' markets and roadside stands throughout this region.
