This concert is probably the most infamous of any The Doors' shows. The story goes that the band's flight had been delayed several times and that Morrison chose to spend the extra time drinking. By the time the band was in front of the audience of 12,000 people he could barely sing or talk coherently, and ended up ranting about politics, then saying the crowd should all take off their clothes and have an orgy, he then allegedly flashing the crowd with his penis for a few seconds saying "that's the only reason they come here anyway." He then picking up a lamb a Coconut Grove local had brought and placed on stage. Morrison started saying he wanted to have sex with it, but said it was too young, which drove the crowd into a frenzy.
