Alnwick Castle's Poison Garden. Established by the Duchess of Northumberland, where its construction first began in 1996. the garden contains over 100 deadly and hallucinogenic plants.Â 

"I wondered why so many gardens around the world focused on the healing power of plants rather than their ability to kill... I felt that most children I knew would be more interested in hearing how a plant killed, how long it would take you to die if you ate it and how gruesome and painful the death might be."

-The Duchess of Northumberland.

Reportedly, every year many visitors ignore the "don't sniff don't touch don't eat" rule and and either faint or vomit. In addition to that it's known that at least on one occasion a driver fainted behind the wheel when transporting poisonous plants to the garden.
